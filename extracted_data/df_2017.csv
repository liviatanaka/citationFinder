Applying a severity-performance loss analysis in service failure research,"This study addresses the shortage of traditional service failure assessment. To strengthen and extend the qualitative interviews and critical incident technique in service encounter research, this study performed a quantitative and graphical “severity-performance loss analysis (SPLA).” The concept of “importance- performance analysis” was used and the frequency and severity of service failures generated from critical incident technique were integrated on a chart to assess service performance loss for different failure categories. The results yield important insights into which failure categories may require attention and effort, and identify service failure categories which offer an advantage, or require continued vigilance. It can help managers identify the service failures and implement more effective and precise improvement strategies in service operations management."
Software as a service based CRM providers in the cloud computing: Challenges and technical issues,"In recent year, cloud computing as a new internet-based computing model provides different service providers dynamically. Today, Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is one of main key points of the computing procedure. However, by raising user interactions, the complexity of the cloud processes is increasing with the advancement of technology. Therefore, providing appropriate services to response the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications are challengeable in cloud environments. To the best of our knowledge, there is no any systematic and detailed review in the field of the SaaS based CRM providers in cloud computing. Therefore, this paper categorizes the SaaS features based on key points of the CRM providers. The SaaS features compared with each other according to important factors of the CRM providers such as business size, service deployment, ease of use, availability and efficiency. The advantages and disadvantages of each provider discussed as well as providing some hints for solving their problems."
Agricultural insurance-agricultural productivity nexus: Evidence from international data,"This article examines the relationship between the development of the agricultural insurance market (using the penetration measure) and the agricultural productivity growth in the context of various factors potentially influencing such relationships. We employ a panel data static model for 23 countries in two continents during the 2000-2015 period. Our main finding is that the development of agricultural insurance market has a positive effect on agricultural productivity growth. Moreover, we show that the conditional variables of a high level of agricultural insurance market penetration, a high level of agriculture credit, a high level of farmers’ education, and a moderated level of agricultural risk management (a low level of expost compensation supplied by the governments in case of catastrophic risks) alleviate the positive impacts of the development of the agricultural insurance market on agricultural productivity growth. By contrast, the conditional variables of a low level of natural risks (drought, floods, and extreme temperatures) and a low level of yield risks strengthen the positive impacts of the development of the agricultural insurance market on agricultural productivity growth."
Medical tourism services: The role of patients’ perceived health consciousness and value,"Medical tourism is traveling to another country for medical services. The transformation of global healthcare system is opening the floodgates for medical tourism. Many factors influence the decision to seek medical tour overseas. Health value in terms of biologically given and personally acquired potentials is based on patient health consciousness, pushing individual take healthy action. The aim of this study is to examine the factors (e.g., consumer’s health consciousness and perceived health value) that affect the satisfaction of medical tourism services. Also, the study considers demography character (e.g., age, gender, income level and health insurance) as moderating effect between satisfaction and loyalty. The data was collected 427 medical tourists’ data for inbound Korean medical tourist. The results show importance of motivating health value regarding medical tourism service’s satisfaction and loyalty while no impact on patients perceived satisfaction and loyalty. Through the results, medical tourism manager will need to develop medical tourism services that can stimulate consumer health values."

Seismic performance of low-rise intermediate steel moment frame buildings in South Korea,"The seismic performance of low-rise intermediate steel moment frame buildings following design practices of South Korea was investigated and its benefit was presented in comparison with those of customary design practice in the United States. The major features in the design and construction practices in South Korea are that the entire frames of the building are designed to resist the lateral load and beam-to-column connections are fabricated in factories. In contrast, in the United States, only exterior frames resist the lateral load and the entire beam-to-column connections are welded at the construction site. To investigate the effects of distinctive design practices on seismic performance, the example buildings were designed and evaluated with the procedure in FEMA 355F. The effect of panel zone deformation in addition to story drift was considered in performance evaluation. The evaluation results showed that the seismic performance of the buildings designed in accordance with the practice in South Korea were not significantly different from those in the United States. Therefore, design and construction practices in South Korea are a competitive way for intermediate steel moment frame buildings."
Axial load capacity of cold-formed steel built-up stub columns,"This paper aims to investigate the axial load capacity of innovative cold-formed steel (CFS) built-up stub columns. Four innovative CFS built up section is presented in this paper. Each section is composed of combination of more than two elements as follows: channels, channels with lip, Sigma section and/or plates. The elements of each section are assembled together by using self tapping screws. The concentric axial load capacity of each of the four sections was investigated numerically by using finite element (FE) model using ABAQUS program. The FE model was verified against previous test data. The FE model was used to study different parameters that affect the load capacities of the innovative CFS built-up stub columns, these parameters are: columns profile, steel thickness, steel grade and longitudinal spacing between screws (fasteners), cross sectional area. The axial load capacities obtained from FE models are compared with the perdition of the Effective width (EW) method (available in Eurocode, Egyptian code, American and Australian standards) and direct strength (DS) method (Available in American and Australian standards)."
Motion-based optimum design of a slender steel footbridge and assessment of its dynamic behaviour,"The improvement of construction materials together with the current aesthetic requirements has led the modern footbridges to a continuous increase in their slenderness. For this reason, the design of their structural systems is mainly conditioned by its dynamic response under pedestrian action. For long-span footbridges, control devices are needed to prevent unacceptable dynamic responses while providing economical designs. However, for medium-span footbridges, it is still possible to control their dynamic response via the modification of their natural frequencies. In this paper, an alternative motion-based design method is first proposed and further implemented for the design of a real footbridge. The main idea of this approach is to optimally determine the structural stiffness distribution to verify an adequate comfort class, while minimizing the self-weight. Furthermore, the uncertainties of its modal parameters are considered during its design. After the construction of the footbridge, its dynamic behaviour was experimentally assessed, with satisfactory results."
Cyclic behavior of concentrically braced frames with built-up braces composed of channel sections,"Concentrically braced frames are earthquake resistant systems commonly used in buildings. Seismic behavior of this type of structures is affected by their configurations, brace properties, and brace to gusset plate connections. In this paper, the results of three experiments conducted to investigate the cyclic behavior of concentrically braced frames with braces built-up of double channels are reported. Significant damage was observed in beam to column connections. Large out of plane deformation of braces caused some cracks in the connector welds; however they did not result in fracture. Although large drift was applied to the frames, no brace fracture was observed. Furthermore, experiments showed that the majority of compressive strength in post-buckling state and a noticeable portion of tensile strength originated from frame action. By choosing connector spacing as the main parameter and using finite element models, a parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of this parameter on this type of frames with two different details of brace to gusset plate connections. It is observed that reducing the connector spacing increases the inelastic strain demand in braces and decreases it in gusset plates. However, gusset plates, which accommodate 2t linear clearance, are less dependent on connector spacing, compared to those accommodating 6t elliptical clearance. It seems that the limitations of slenderness ratio of individual section, stipulated in current seismic provisions, need further study."
Vibration control of smart TMD for retractable-roof spatial structure considering closed and open roof condition,"A retractable-roof system is frequently adapted to the spatial structure of stadiums and sports halls. The geometric shape and mass location are varied by opening or closing the roof, resulting in a change in the dynamic characteristics of the retractable-roof spatial structure. A passive tuned mass damper (TMD) shows good vibration control performance of the spatial structures when it is tuned properly. Because the closed or open roof condition of a retractable spatial structure causes off-tuning, multiple smart tuned mass dampers (STMD) were developed in this study to increase the control performance in the case of off-tuning. Initially, the dynamic characteristics variations of the opened or closed roof conditions were investigated using an example retractable spatial structure. The control performances of a passive TMD and smart TMD were evaluated under off-tuning conditions. For this purpose, artificial ground motion was generated based on the Korean Building Code (KBC) 2016. Multiple smart TMDs were comprised of magnetorheological (MR) dampers. A fuzzy logic control algorithm (FLC) was used to generate the command voltages sent to the MR dampers and the FLC was optimized by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Numerical analyses showed that the smart TMD had better control performance than the passive TMD. In the case of the off-tuning condition, the difference in control performance between passive and smart TMDs increased."
Numerical and experimental investigation of composite steel shear wall with opening,"Shear walls are used in towers as lateral loading resistance. Composite steel shear wall (CSSW) because of high stiffness and deformability are widely used. This wall made of a thin steel plate with reinforced a concrete layer, which is attached to one or both sides of the steel plate. This system is similar to stiffened steel plate shear wall. The present experimental and numerical studies were focused on the effects of opening used as windows or doors in buildings on the CSSW behavior. Experimental studies results of one and three-story CSSWs with the scale of 1:3 are reported. In addition, the effects of opening size and location are insignificant on the composite steel shear walls behavior. Results showed that opening decrease CSSW strength. Opening at the sides and corners further reduces the resistance than Opening at the center."
Seismic performance evaluation of a structure retrofitted using steel slit dampers with shape memory alloy bars,"In this paper, a hybrid slit- shape memory alloy (SMA) energy dissipation device is devised by attaching a SMA bar to each face of a steel slit plate. An analysis model of a SMA bar with super elastic capability is developed using various link elements, and the accuracy of the analysis model is verified by comparing with finite element analysis results. The seismic performance of the hybrid slit damper is verified by incorporating them in seven-story steel structure. The nonlinear dynamic analysis results of the model structure subjected to seven earthquake ground motions show that the addition of SMA bars in slit damper results in significant reduction both in the maximum and the residual deformation compared to those of the structure installed with typical steel slit dampers."
A simplified numerical model for post-tensioned steel connections with bolted angles,"Post-tensioned (PT) self-centering beam–column connections has been developed for its good seismic performance. Many researchers have investigated its mechanical behavior by numerical or experimental method. Prior researches have indicated that the analysis by elaborate FE models is very time consuming. To overcome this disadvantage, a simplified numerical model was established in this paper. The accuracy of results derived by this model was validated against prior investigations on interior PT connections with top-and-seat angles. Influence of initial PT force on mechanical behavior of PT connection was investigated. The Geometric and material nonlinearities, and strands can be considered in the modeling. A planar steel frame structure was established and hysteretic analysis was conducted. Results indicated that the computational cost can be greatly reduced by this model."
Study on the influence of the initial deflection and load combination on the collapse behaviour of continuous stiffened panels,"Using the finite element analysis, a series stiffened panels under combined normal loads and biaxial compressions are conducted to investigate the effect of several influential factors on the ultimate limit states. Two spans/bays FE model with periodical boundary condition is adopted to consider the interaction between adjacent structural members. The initial deflections assumed as Fourier components including symmetric and asymmetric modes are used to identify the half-wave number of collapse of the local plate, which is compared with half-wave number of buckling calculated by formula. Based on the numerical results, the influences of half-wave number assumed in the equivalent initial imperfection and loads combination on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels are discussed. It is found that lateral pressure might increase the ultimate strength of stiffened panels for the stiffener-induced failure modes. The one half-wave region of local plate influences significantly the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels."
An experimental study on bending performance of Hybrid forming composite beam,"The new shape of Hybrid forming beam is a beam that two Z-shaped side plates and bottom plate are connected by high-strength bolt. By adjusting the height of Z-shaped side plate, it can be designed for required resistance and by adjusting the thickness of bottom plate and applying high-strength steel to it, nominal bending moment can be increased. In addition, if concrete is filled inside of the beam during the slab concrete installation process, it becomes the Hybrid forming composite beam which usability and fire resistance are increased. This study suggests the new shape of the Hybrid forming composite beam that applied high-strength steel to the bottom plate and this study acquired the conclusion as the following by the bending test. First, if the existing evaluating formula which evaluates the resistance of the couple moment by the compressive resistance and tensile resistance is applied to evaluating bending resistance of the Hybrid forming composite beam, the ratio of maximum load for the nominal load is more than 1.2 times on average, matches well with the experiment result. Second, if the bending stiffness of the Hybrid forming composite beam is calculated as the effective bending stiffness based on concrete that subjected to compression and steel that subjected to tension, it confirmed to reflect the experimental result well."
Assessment of structural behavior of transmission line tower using strain gauging method,"Design of latticed steel transmission towers is a challenging task which involves lengthy modeling and detailing of significant amount of steel members and connections. After that full scale testing of towers validates the modeling and detailing and ensures that the towers are designed to withstand design loads without premature failures. In present work, a 132 kilovolt double circuit suspension tower has been considered for study. The tower was designed using Staad.pro software and the member forces were calculated at design loads. After design, the full scale testing of the tower was carried out. During testing, the strains in some of the critical members were measured using strain gauges. Using these strain values, the actual load in selected members are calculated. The paper provides the comparison between actual load in members during full scale testing and computed loads from software. The paper also discusses the possible reasons behind the difference between actual and computed loads. Loads on the tower at different points for different conditions are presented. The paper also provides a discussion about the possible reasons of premature failure of tower during full scale testing or at site and the remedial measures are presented to avoid the failure."
Retrofitting of Steel Moment-Resisting Frames under fire loading against progressive collapse,"Generally, fire has been one of the most important threats which can lead to the collapse of structures. Due to the high temperature caused by fire, material strength decrease significantly and finally, could lead to failure of different members of a structure. When some parts of the structure are damaged, frames without sufficient resistance and ductility can progressively collapse. In this study, the retrofitting effect of a Steel Moment-Resisting Frame (MRFs) with X and inverted-V braces are investigated using dynamic explicit analysis for frames which had previously suffer progressive collapse under fire. Simultaneously, different bracing systems and fire conditions have been used. Furthermore, the effect of stiffness and strength of bracing systems were numerically analyzed. Studies show that the unbraced moment-resisting frame (MRF) lacks an effective mechanism for transferring loads from failed parts to the neighboring parts and the frame completely collapse due to the catenary actions under fire loading in central span. Systems braced with hat truss, due to their distance from the heated columns, have limited capacity to prevent the pull-in of columns in the heated floor. However, they can directly re-distribute vertical loads which are shed by buckled columns to the neighboring columns. But, their performance in central span fire scenario seems relatively better than edge span fire scenario. On the other hand, vertical bracing systems have a good effect and with restraining the columns, it can prevent them from pull-in. Also, they are able to effectively prevent the global collapse process. Furthermore, the stronger vertical bracing system can decrease the vertical movement of the heated columns and thus, enhance the re-distribution capacity of the frame. Accordingly, with combination of hat truss bracing system and vertical bracing system, new paths can be generated for redistribution of the forces which are shed by failed columns in the frame. At the end, comparing between X bracing systems and inverted-V bracing systems indicates that the frames with inverted-V bracing systems show more ductility."
Reliability-based optimization of steel truss arch bridges,"A reliability-based optimization approach is developed and applied to minimize the weight of steel truss arch bridges subject to probabilistic (the overall probability failure of the structure) and deterministic (stress and deflection) constraints. The method intelligently integrates the genetic algorithm (GA), the finite element method and the first order reliability method. A real-coded/integer-coded method is used to realistically represent the values of the design variables. Three GA operators consisting of constraint aggregate selection procedure, arithmetic crossover, and non-uniform mutation are proposed. The finite element method (FEM) and the first order reliability method are used to compute the value of the probabilistic and deterministic constraint functions. A numerical example involving a detailed computational model of a long span steel arch bridge with a main span of 550 m is presented to demonstrate the applicability and merits of the present method. Finally, several important parameters in the present method are discussed."
Concept proposal and feasibility verification of the Annular Crossed Cable-Truss Structure,"A new concept for improving the robustness of pre-stressed spatial structures was introduced. The purpose of this concept is to avoid existing key elements by creating an alternative load path for every structural member. With this new concept, the Annular Crossed Cable-Truss Structure was proposed. How to defining the target geometry, force-finding, and designing connections for the Annular Crossed Cable-Truss Structure were illustrated by means of designing an experimental set-up. Feasibility of the structure, including self-weight, structural stiffness, and structural adaptability in asymmetric load arrangement, was discussed based on experimental results. The results show that the Annular Crossed Cable-Truss Structure can have a light self-weight, reasonable structural stiffness, and acceptable adaptability in asymmetric load arrangement. It is concluded that the Annular Crossed Cable-Truss Structure is a feasible pre-stressed spatial structure."
Numerical analysis on mechanical property of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) columns subjected to ISO-834 standard fire,"The present study established a numerical investigation on the behavior of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) columns subjected to fire. A finite element analysis (FEA) model was built to simulate the performance of CFSTRC columns under combined loading and fire. The FEA model was verified by the experimental results of CFSTRC columns subjected to fire. The comparison demonstrated an acceptable accuracy for the proposed FEA model. Afterwards, the FEA model was used to analyze the failure modes, the redistribution of internal force, the changes and development of the stress and strain, and the contact stress between the tube and concrete of CFSTRC columns subjected to fire. Influencing factors that may affect the bearing capacity of the CFSTRC columns subjected to fire were analyzed. The bearing capacity and stiffness of the CFSTRC columns gradually decreased in the fire; the parameters such as the fire duration time, sectional dimension, slenderness ratio, and sectional core area ratio significantly influenced the bearing capacity of the CFSTRC columns. Finally, a simplified calculating formula was proposed to calculate the influence factors of the bearing capacity of the CFSTRC columns subjected to ISO-834 standard fire. The formula-calculated results were well in agreement with the finite element analysis results, which provide a simple and feasible method for evaluating the fire-resistance design of these types of components in practical engineering."
Numerical analysis on structural behaviors of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) columns subjected to 3-side fire,"The structural behaviors of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) columns, which were exposed to a 3-side fire were discussed by using the non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) software ABAQUS. Details of the temperature distribution, fire resistance, failure modes, redistribution of internal force, contact stress between the steel tube and the concrete (both inside and outside of the steel tube), and the development of stress and strain within the CFSTRC columns subjected to a 3-side fire were revealed. The factors that may have affected the fire resistance of the CFSTRC columns exposed to three-side fire were analyzed. Based on the above research, the present study observed uniaxial symmetry on the cross-sectional thermal distribution of the CFSTRC, wherein a significantly lower temperature on the unexposed side was observed as compared to the exposed side. The two side verges of the surface, which were not exposed to fire, exhibited the lowest temperature. Following the end of the heating, the maximum temperature difference reached about 1065oC. The large temperature difference would bring non-uniform thermal stress and strain, and accidental eccentricity. In addition, the existence of concrete inside and outside of the steel tube prevented the steel tube from occurring local buckling, and the failure modes of CFSTRC columns acted as overall bucking. Parameters such as the fire load ratio, sectional dimension, slenderness ratio, sectional core area ratio, and external concrete compression strength significantly influenced the fire resistance of the CFSTRC columns. Finally, a simplified calculating formula was proposed to calculate the fire resistance influence factors of the CFSTRC columns subjected to three-sid fire. The formula-calculated results were well in agreement with the finite element analysis results, thereby providing a simple and feasible method for evaluating the fire-resistance design of these types of components in practical engineering."
Shear capacity of cold-formed light-gauge steel framed shear-wall panels with fiber cement board sheathing,"Being light in weight, cold-formed steel shear wall panels (SWPs) made with light gauge steel are extensively used in residential and office buildings (low to mid-rise), particularly in structures under seismic loadings. Many design practices involve the use of fiber cement board (FCB) as sheathing material both for hollow and infilled walls. FCB is a preferred choice as cladding material due to many advantages it provides such as water resistance, lower cost, withstand temperature variation, resistance to humidity and termite attack, better acoustic insulation, and superior fire resistance properties. In the absence of design guidelines, based on cold-formed light gauge steel shear walls with FCB sheathing, the designers resolve to use the guideline available for gypsum wall board (GWB) and fiberboard (FB) available in American Iron and Steel Institute Lateral Design. As a pioneer study, an experimental program was designed to investigate the behavior of cold-formed light gauge steel shear walls, both hollow and infilled with expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam concrete, with FCB sheathing on both sides under monotonic loading. The tests were performed according to ASTM E564 standard. Results show that the strength of shear walls with FCB sheathing is much higher than GWB and FB sheathing, suggesting that substitute design practices are highly conservative. Test results can help designers choose desired lateral stiffness and load carrying capacity of light gauge steel SWPs more efficiently, by selecting appropriate framing, infill, and sheathing material."
Dynamic investigation of a two story-two span frame including semi-rigid Khorjini connections,"In this paper, the free vibration analysis and determination of dynamic parameters of a two story-two span frame is investigated. The frame is consisted of two continuous beams and three columns, in which the middle connections of the continuous beams to the column are provided by means of semi-rigid Khorjini connections. The individual members of the frame are assumed to be governed by the transverse vibration theory of an Euler-Bernoulli beam and the semi-rigid Khorjini connections are modeled employing rotational springs. First of all, a closed-form solution is proposed and then, a numerical analysis is performed for some comparison and validation purposes. At the closed-form solution, some differential equations must be solved, and several boundary conditions should be satisfied. Herein, 40 boundary conditions should be provided. Afterward, the eigenvalues of the frame are obtained. These eigenvalues are also obtained using finite element method as a numerical analysis and it is observed that the results obtained by this approach are completely identical with the result of closed-form solution. Also, the eigenvalues and mode shapes of the frame for different values of the semi-rigid Khorjini connections stiffnesses are obtained and some comparisons are made."
Smart outrigger damper system for response reduction of tall buildings subjected to wind and seismic excitations,"The outrigger damper system has recently been proposed to reduce the dynamic response of tall buildings subjected to lateral loads. Previous studies have shown that the outrigger damper system could effectively increase the response reduction capacity of tall buildings. The outrigger damper system was used not only for a response reduction of tall buildings, but also for adjusting the differential column shortening. When an outrigger damper system is designed optimally for wind or earthquake loads, it shows good control performance against each target excitation. On the other hand, the outrigger damper system designed for the wind load cannot effectively control the seismic responses and vice versa. This study examined the control performance of a smart outrigger damper system for reducing both the wind and seismic responses. The smart outrigger damper system was comprised of magnetorheological dampers. A fuzzy logic control algorithm, which was optimized by a multi-objective genetic algorithm, was used to control the smart outrigger damper system. Numerical analysis showed that the smart outrigger damper system could provide superior control performance for the reduction of both wind and earthquake responses compared to the general outrigger system and passive outrigger damper system."
Inelastic moment-rotation response of 690 MPa grade steel I-section girders,"Recent specifications have adopted moment-rotation relationships for I-section girders with yield strengths up to 485 MPa to realize adequate and reliable ductility and the development of strength significantly greater than the yield moment. In this study, experiments were performed in order to verify the inelastic moment strength and examine an equation that appropriately expresses the inelastic moment-rotation response of high-strength steel I-section girders in the negative moment region. Three test girder specimens were fabricated and tested to their ultimate bending strengths up to failure. The test results were compared with the maximum strengths predicted for I-girders by finite element analysis and the nominal moment-plastic rotation curve in the specifications. A sufficiently redundant shakedown behavior was revealed by the comparison, which experimentally confirmed the adequacy of the current design equation for the moment-plastic rotation curve to 690 MPa grade steel I-girders. Based on the experimental results, conclusions were drawn regarding the inelastic moment-rotation behavior."
Investigation of the structural behavior of an innovative steel open-web floor system,"An experimental study was conducted on a steel open-web floor system, in which the top and bottom chords are connected by a steel square tube to form a vertical web member. A full-scale flexural test was performed to evaluate the flexural performance and failure mechanisms of the floor system. The steel open-web floor structure demonstrated a satisfactory composite behavior, and the loading capacity increased to 2.6 times the working load. A parametric study was performed to examine the effects of three geometric properties. Increasing the size of the cross sections exerted a significant effect on stiffness, and the load capacity of the open web floor system was enhanced significantly. Results show that the design method and philosophy of the open-web floor structure are in accordance with Eurocode 4 and the Chinese Code for the Design of Steel Structures."
A proposal for a seismic design process for a passive control structural system based on the energy equilibrium equation,"A systematic design method for actualizing a passive control structure that can effectively exert its capabilities to minimize damage from an earthquake has yet to be presented. In particular, a clear method for placing EDDs that can improve seismic capability under earthquake delivery has yet to be presented, causing the dependence on the design of placing the damper after repetitive response analysis and trial and error work directly. However, in order to obtain seismic capability that the designer intends, the designer needs to be able to predict optimum placement of the damper prior to response analysis and determine the design result to be reliable. This study aims to suggest a design process of passive control structure, which includes design and placement of the damper for obtaining the seismic capability of the passive control structure as intended by the designer. Also, dynamic response analysis was conducted on structures designed using the design process suggested in this study to confirm whether the seismic capability intended by the design has been achieved, verifying the validity of the design process."

"Topical Minoxidil Versus Topical Diltiazem for Chemical Sphincterotomy of Chronic Anal Fissure: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Clinical Trial",Anal fissure is a common anorectal problem causing severe pain and discomfort to the patients. Chemical sphincterotomy has emerged as a noninvasive alternative to the surgical methods of fissure treatment.

Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Two-Pot-Synthesized BiFeO3–ZnFe2O4 Heterojunction Nanocomposite,"BiFeO3–ZnFe2O4 heterojunction nanocomposites have been produced by a chemical synthesis method using one- and two-pot approaches. X-ray diffraction patterns of as-calcined samples indicated formation of pure zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) and bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) phases, each retaining its crystal structure. Diffuse reflectance spectrometry was applied to calculate the optical bandgap of the photocatalysts, revealing values in the range from 2.03 eV to 2.17 eV, respectively. The maximum photodegradation of methylene blue of about 97% was achieved using two-pot-synthesized photocatalyst after 120 min of visible-light irradiation due to the higher probability of charge separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the heterojunction structure. Photoluminescence spectra showed lower emission intensity of two-pot-synthesized photocatalyst, due to its lower recombination rate originating from greater charge separation."
"XPS Spectra Analysis of Ti2+, Ti3+ Ions and Dye Photodegradation Evaluation of Titania-Silica Mixed Oxide Nanoparticles","TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides have been prepared by the sol–gel technique from tetrabutyl orthotitanate and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The prepared materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that the TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides have a large surface area and a nanoscale size. FT-IR spectra show that Ti atoms are bonded to silica by oxygen bridging atoms in Ti-O-Si bonds. The titanium valence states in TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides were investigated by XPS, and their spectra report the presence of Ti2+ and Ti3+ cations for high silica concentration, suggesting the formation of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials has been evaluated for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). The mixed oxides were activated by means of a UV light source, and the concentration of MB was monitored by UV–Vis spectroscopy. The synthesized TiO2-SiO2 shows significantly higher MB removal efficiency in comparison with that of the commercial TiO2 Degussa, P25."
Comprehensive Evaluation of Modification Level Assessment in Sr-Modified Aluminium Alloys,"One way to improve the mechanical properties of Al–Si alloys is to add chemical modifiers that affect the microstructure of the cast components. Small amounts of Sr cause the modification of the eutectic Si particles from a coarse plate-like morphology into a fine fibrous one. This study sets out to analyse the effects of chemical modification on an Al–7%Si–0.3%Mg foundry alloy treated with Sr, ranging from 62 to 820 ppm. Assessment of modification level was evaluated by both thermal analysis technique and quantitative microstructural investigations. Up to now, little attention has been paid to the role played by microstructural characteristics in evaluating the modification level, which is commonly performed by comparison with standard images. In the present investigation, numerical methods proposed in the literature have been considered in an attempt to understand their effectiveness. The correlation between thermal analysis results and geometrical parameters of eutectic Si particles highlighted the impact of microstructural homogeneity on modification-level evaluation. In addition, the presence of Ca in Sr-based intermetallics has been further investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy."
Operations for Suspected Neoplasms in a Resource-Limited Setting: Experience and Challenges in the Eastern Democratic of Congo,"Surgery is an essential component of a functional health system, with surgical conditions accounting for nearly 11–15% of world disability. While communicable diseases continue to burden low- and low–middle-income countries, non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on malignancies in low- and middle-income countries, specifically in Africa, suggest a higher mortality compared to other regions of the world, a difference partially explained by limited availability of screening and early detection systems as well as poorer access to treatment."

One-Hour Postoperative Parathyroid Hormone Levels Do Not Reliably Predict Hypocalcemia After Thyroidectomy,"Hypocalcemia is a well-known complication after total thyroidectomy. Studies have indicated that the presence of low postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels can predict hypocalcemia. However, definitive study designs are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether postoperative PTH alone can accurately predict postoperative biochemical hypocalcemia."
Experimental and analytical studies on bearing capacity of bolt connected composite plate girders,"Composite plate girders bearing the enormous concentrated loads from boilers are common members in thermal power plants. Because of their large scale and sustaining distinct loads, the section of these girders is made of two parts combined with high strength bolts. Experimental investigations on two I-section plate girders, two homogeneous composite girders, and two hybrid composite girders, are implemented. Bearing capacity and member ductility are compared among the three kinds of specimens. To reveal the mechanism of composite plate girders, force method built upon the linear elastic theory is employed, according to deformation coordination among the components. The elastic stress distribution predicted by the analytical method is validated against test data. Based on the internal force distribution derived, the elastic effective width method in current specifications and the plastic effective width method proposed in other published literature are employed herein to predict the critical load. Conclusions can be made that bearing capacity of composite girders is superior to the I-section ones, and hybrid composite plate girders can further balance the economic and mechanical efficiency of constructions. Additionally, several proposals for application are offered."
Failure modes and loading bearing capacity of corrugated steel roofs connected by standing seam clips,"This paper presents the research on failure modes and loading bearing capacity of two types of purlin-sheet roofs under uniform loadings. The full-size experiments are carried out on the purlin-sheet roofs and the allowable design stress and design proposals are proposed. Besides, the finite element analysis is conducted to compare with the experiments. Results show that the failure modes and loading bearing capacity of two types of purlin-sheet roofs are different. The first is that the adjustments are pulled out from the base, while the mechanical occlusions between the adjacent sheet and adjustments are well. The latter is that the mechanical occlusions between the adjustment and sheets are tensioned fracture, while the adjustment are tensioned straight and pulled out from the sheets. The numerical calculations and experiment data are in good agreement, and the deviations are mainly because of initial defects of specimens, construction errors of specimens and loading protocols. The numerical calculation method is reliable and can be used to analyze the sheet-purlin roof connected by standing seam clips."
Development of a fatigue experiment for the stiffener-to-deck plate connection in Orthotropic Steel Decks,"Orthotropic Steel Decks (OSDs) are widely used in long span steel bridges since they are extremely light weighted and very efficient for resisting localized traffic loads. As this type of bridge deck consists of a complex network of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners, it is very sensitive to fatigue. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding concerning the actual fatigue behaviour. Therefore, a small-scale fatigue test has been designed for which the stresses would correspond with actual OSDs. Taking into account the possibilities available in laboratory conditions, the stress distribution at the considered weld does not perfectly match when using only one longitudinal stiffener. Nevertheless, relevant test data was obtained showing the dominance of weld toe cracks. In addition, beach marks are added during the tests. As a result, more information became available about the crack propagation. This information is very helpful when using fatigue assessment tools such as fracture mechanics."
Damage evaluation of reinforced concrete and steel frames under critical successive scenarios,"This paper compares the vulnerability of initial shock-damage reinforced concrete (RC) with steel frames in successive scenarios, as an essential part of developing a framework to consider seismic sequence hazard into structural design. For this, two sets of regular RC and steel moment resisting frames with 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 15 stories, are designed and analyzed under two different databases with/without seismic sequences in OpenSees software.The damage states of the model frames were then measured by the Park and Ang’s damage index. From the results of this investigation, it is observed that only considering the mainshock will underestimate the seismic risk in both sets of RC and steel frames. The results of damage evaluation also reveal that RC frames have better performance than steel frames in seismic sequence phenomena. Furthermore, steel frames damage is about 53% more than the damage caused by RC frames under critical successive earthquakes."
Shear behavior of large-diameter concrete filled tube (CFT),"Circular concrete filled tube (CFT) is composite structure to fill concrete in steel tube as formwork. By combining advantage of steel tube and concrete, CFT has more superior deformation capacity and strength than reinforced concrete and steel structure, since bond stress between steel tube and concrete has influence on prevention of local buckling and increase in strength of concrete. For such a reason, CFT has been applied to as columns in buildings, and pile and drilled shaft foundations. CFT drilled shaft is designed to large diameter due to large local shear strength by seismic load, liquefaction and lateral spreading of soil layer. However, it brings uneconomical design by the conservative shear equation of current design provision. Until today, shear studies of circular CFT to improve shear equation have been rarely conducted and they are limited to small scale test. In this research, the numerical and experimental results are compared to current shear design equations, with the ultimate goal to serve as an initial analytical study that aids in planning further experimental and analytical research on shear resistance and behavior of circular CFT, which leads to improved shear design equations."
On the prediction of arresting efficiency of integral buckle arrestors for deepwater pipelines,"Dedicated finite element models are developed to simulate the crossing of a pipeline integral buckle arrestor by a buckle propagating under the quasi-static, steady-state condition. In addition, broad parametric studies are conducted to identify the mechanism governing the arresting performance, which consider the geometric characteristics and material properties of the pipe and arrestor. Based upon the extensive study, the more reasonable empirical design formulas for the crossover pressure and the arresting efficiency are established by means of the partial fitting. Good agreements between the existing experimental results and the predictions demonstrate that the proposed empirical formula and the lower bound envelope line for the arresting efficiency provide a powerful design tool to estimate the arresting performance of such complex structure systems in engineering practices."
Experimental research and numerical simulation of a large-span isolated structure considering multi-dimensional input effects,"Based on the shaking table test of 1:20 scale structural models of the large-span isolated and non-isolated flat grid structures under the action of horizontal-bidirectional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) rare earthquake, the dynamic characteristics, including natural vibration frequency, damping ratio, the acceleration and displacement responses are investigated. The results show that the base isolation could significantly prolong the structural vibration periods and increase the damping ratio. The capacity of energy dissipation for the base-isolated structure can also be improved. The horizontal acceleration amplification factors (AAFs) of the structure can be reduced greatly due to the base isolation, which effectively reduces the vertical vibration of the large-span grid. Under the 3D seismic input, the horizontal AAF of each layer is greater than that under the 2D one, which illustrates that the vertical seismic input increases the horizontal dynamic response of the structure. Furthermore, the finite element models of the isolated and non-isolated structures were simulated. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical results. The parameter optimization of isolation bearings was conducted by using finite element software. The seismic response of each layer under different shear to weight ratios (μ) was analyzed. It can be found that the parameters of the isolation layer have an optimal range which makes the dynamic response of the structure reach a minimum value under the rare earthquake."
Qos prediction for web services based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"Recently, reliability prediction of Web services has become very important in related research communities. Especially, predicting the Quality of Service (QoS) for active users has been a hot issue of research and application. On the other hand, with the rapidly growing in number of service providers and users, resulting in a large number of data sets. It has a big impact to the QoS such as managing and monitoring for describing functional and nonfunctional characteristics of Web services. Therefore, we will certainly struggle at processing large data sets in the future, unless the issues are resolved quickly before it happens. In that context, QoS prediction on big data set is an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we present a new model for handling this problem based on a Restricted Boltzmann Machines, it is called Two Layers Model (TLM) and also proposed to add a new method for evaluating prediction of the field of web service quality. We use this model to cope with large data sets and the model has been used by the efficient learning and inference procedures for predicting QoS values of Web services. Our experiments were performed on two data sets in the WSDREAM data set and the experimental results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed model."
Characteristics of customer value creation in digital services,"This paper examines the characteristics of customer value creation in the digital services. The results of this study are based on research involving two B2B case studies. The collected data includes recorded and transcribed interviews, as well as reports from focus group meetings. Similar research processes were used in both cases to ensure scientific transparency and repeatability. Based on the results, the characteristics of customer value creation in the digital services are similar to those of traditional services, however, different characteristics are emphasized. The role of openness and communication is emphasized in the delivery of digital services, because the customer is not involved in the actual production of a service. In addition, in the digital environment, customer control is emphasized in terms of cooperation and the quality of the services."
Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Behavior of High Temperature Solders: Effects of High Temperature Aging,"This paper explores the effects of aging on the mechanical behavior, microstructure evolution and IMC formation on different surface finishes of two high temperature solders, Sn-5 wt.% Ag and Sn-5 wt.% Sb. High temperature aging showed significant degradation of Sn-5 wt.% Ag solder hardness (34%) while aging has little effect on Sn-5 wt.% Sb solder. Sn-5 wt.% Ag experienced rapid grain growth as well as the coarsening of particles during aging. Sn-5 wt.% Sb showed a stable microstructure due to solid solution strengthening and the stable nature of SnSb precipitates. The increase of intermetallic compound (IMC) thickness during aging follows a parabolic relationship with time. Regression analysis (time exponent, n) indicated that IMC growth kinetics is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. The results have important implications in the selection of high temperature solders used in high temperature applications."
"Evidence of Room Temperature Ferromagnetism Due 
to Oxygen Vacancies in (In1−xFe
x
)2O3 Thin Films","Iron substituted indium oxide (In1−xFe
x
)2O3 thin films at x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07 were coated onto Corning 7059 glass substrates using the electron beam evaporation technique followed by annealing at different temperatures. The prepared thin films were subjected to different characterization techniques to study their structural, optical and magnetic properties. The structural properties of the thin films were studied using x-ray diffractometry (XRD). From the XRD results it was found that the films were crystallized in cubic structure, and no change in crystal structure was observed with annealing temperature. No secondary phases related to iron were observed from the XRD profiles. The chemical composition and surface morphology of the films were examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) attached with energy dispersive analysis of x-ray (EDAX). The valence state of the elements were studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and found that the indium, iron and oxygen were in In+3, Fe+3 and O−2 states. From the data, the band gap of the (In1−xFe
x
)2O3 thin films were calculated and it increased with increase of annealing temperature. The magnetic properties of the films were studied at room temperature by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The films exhibited ferromagnetism at room temperature."
Face verification based on deep Bayesian convolutional neural network in unconstrained environment,"Unconstrained face verification aims to verify whether two specify images contain the same person. In this paper, we propose a deep Bayesian convolutional neural network (DBCNN) framework to extract facial features and measure their similarity for face verification in unconstrained conditions. Specifically, we design a deep convolutional neural network and construct a Bayesian probabilistic model by transferring the Bayesian likelihood ratio function into linear decision function. By training a decision line rather than finding a suitable threshold, we further enlarge the distances between inter-class and intra-class in unconstrained environment. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate our method on LFW, CACD-VS and MegaFace datasets. The test results on LFW and CACD-VS datasets show that our method can shrink intra-class variations significantly. The performance of our DBCNN model on MegaFace dataset proves that our model can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on face verification with relative small training data and only one single network."
Does apprenticeship improve job opportunities? A regression discontinuity approach,"In Italy the main difference between apprentices and other types of temporary workers is that apprentices must receive firm-provided training. The firm incentive in hiring apprentices consists in paying lower wages and labour taxes. Using an Italian administrative dataset containing information on the jobs started between January 2009 and June 2012, we estimate the effect of apprenticeship on the hazard function to a permanent job. Identification is based on a regression discontinuity design. We find that, for 29-year-old workers, apprenticeships are “long entrance halls” towards permanent contracts, especially within the firm where the apprenticeship is performed."
Trabecular bone quality is lower in adults with type 1 diabetes and is negatively associated with insulin resistance,"We evaluated trabecular bone score (TBS) and factors affecting TBS in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched adults without diabetes. Adults with T1D had lower TBS compared to controls. Abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are associated with lower TBS."
File changes with security proof stored in cloud service systems,"This paper proposes a new scheme in cloud service applied to smart home systems based on the technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the key technologies include sensing technology and cloud computing ability. The IoT refers to the network of objects, devices, machines, and other physical systems with computing and communication capabilities. On the smart home paradigm, the data collected from sensors can be sensitive information and that security breaches can have devastating economic and social impact. This paper proposes a platform to prevent collusion between users and the cloud service provider (CSP). To protect the privacy of the checked data, the leakage of personnel information in the protocol for the proof must be considered. The proposed protocol can verify users who modify shared files, so that a cloud-storage practice is considered safe. In addition, the proposed method preserves data privacy and minimizes computational cost by applying the bilinearity property of bilinear pairings."
Mother’s attachment history and antenatal attachment to the second baby: the moderating role of parenting efficacy in raising the firstborn child,"In this exploratory study, we examined the associations between mothers’ attachment history, parenting efficacy in raising the firstborn child, and antenatal attachment to the second baby. Mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy with their second child were recruited to attend this quantitative study. Data were obtained by means of mother-report questionnaires. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their attachment to their own mother, parenting efficacy in raising their first child, and antenatal attachment to their second baby. Hierarchical regression modeling was conducted. Mothers’ attachment to their own mother was associated with antenatal attachment to their second baby, but this association was moderated by parenting efficacy in raising the first child. Specifically, mothers’ attachment to their own mother was positively associated with antenatal attachment among mothers with high parenting efficacy. The results suggest that parenting efficacy may enhance the role of maternal attachment on emotional relationships between second-time mothers and their baby during the pregnancy. Second-time mothers who experienced low parenting efficacy in raising their first child should receive training in parenting. It may be beneficial to take parenting-related cognition into account when planning interventions."
U–Pb zircon age of the base of the Ediacaran System at the southern margin of the Qinling Orogen,"Global abrupt climate change from Marinoan snowball Earth to greenhouse Earth, recorded as cap carbonate overlain on diamictite, had shed the first light on Cambrian bio-radiation. The most documented cap carbonate sections are typical with comprehensive δ13C negative values and ubiquitous sedimentary structures, such as tepee-like, sheet-crack etc., which are associated with successive glacial eustatic variation caused by isostatic rebound in shallow-water facies. Here we report a deep-water basinal cap carbonate section with strong negative δ13C values in the southern margin of the Qinling Orogen, Heyu, Chengkou County, Chongqing in China, which consists of massive dolostone with abundant carbonaceous laminae. However, it lacks the sedimentary structure as mentioned above and is overlain by thin-bedded silicious shales and cherts. A K-bentonite bed was discovered within the base of cap carbonates, about 0.7 m above the top of the Marinoan diamictite. Magmatic zircons that were separated from the K-bentonite bed yield a SIMS concordia U–Pb age of 634.1 ± 1.9 Ma (1σ, MSWDCE = 0.31, ProbabilityCE = 1.000, n = 20). The age is in good agreement with previously reported TIMS U–Pb ages for the termination of Marinoan glaciation and provides a geochronological constraint for the Ediacaran successions in the Qinling Orogen."
Beyond ICOM8: perspectives on advances in mycorrhizal research from 2015 to 2017,"This report reviews important advances in mycorrhizal research that occurred during the past 2 years. We highlight major advancements both within and across levels of biological organization and describe areas where greater integration has led to unique insights. Particularly active areas of research include exploration of the mechanisms underpinning the development of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, the mycorrhizal microbiome, comparisons among types of mycorrhizas from molecular to ecosystem scales, the extent and function of mycorrhizal networks and enhanced understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in carbon dynamics from local to global scales. The top-tier scientific journals have acknowledged mycorrhizas to be complex adaptive systems that play key roles in the development of communities and ecosystem processes. Understanding the mechanisms driving these large-scale effects requires integration of knowledge across scales of biological organization."
Implications of an Unlimited Fertility Policy in China: Lessons from Low Fertility and Population Aging in Japan and Korea,"In 2016 China began implementing a new population strategy after having maintained a one-child policy for 35 years. This paper draws on the lessons we can learn about low fertility and population aging in Japan and South Korea to consider the implications of the newly announced ‘universal two-child’ policy in China. Japan, Korea and China share many socio-cultural characteristics and have undergone similar processes with respect to low fertility and population aging at different periods of time. Many scholars argue that China’s family planning program has greatly reduced China’s fertility level, but the effects of other socioeconomic factors have, in fact, had a greater impact on the reduction of the fertility rate than the one-child policy had. Considering the effects of the fertility policy that limits the number of births in China and the lessons we can get from unsuccessful fertility boosting measures in Japan and Korea, this paper suggests that a fertility policy that puts no limits on births should be adopted in China."
Chiral Pyrrolidine Bridged Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes as Heterogeneous Catalysts for Asymmetric Michael Additions,"A chiral pyrrolidine bridged polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (SQ) was synthesized, characterized, and used as an effective heterogeneous catalyst. The synthesis involves two simple steps: nucleophilic substitution between benzylchloride functionalized SQ and imidazoyl pyrrolidine carboxylate and subsequent deprotection. The catalyst was isolated by simple filtration. The SQ-supported chiral pyrrolidine catalyst was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in an asymmetric Michael addition into nitrostyrenes under room temperature and neat condition, giving the product in excellent yields (85–91%), diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1) and enantioselectivities (95–98%). The catalyst can be recycled by a simple filtration without a significant loss in its reactivity and selectivity."
Presynaptic serotonin 5-HT1B/D receptor-mediated inhibition of glycinergic transmission to the frog spinal motoneurons,"Endogenous monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) is a phylogenetically ancient neurotransmitter present in vertebrates. The functions of 5-HT in central nervous system are intensively studied; however, the presynaptic effects of 5-HT in frog spinal motoneurons are practically unexplored. We have previously shown that 5-HT decreases the frequency of glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (mIPSPs), but does not affect the frequency of GABAergic mIPSPs and increases the frequency of glutamatergic postsynaptic potentials. In the present study, using pharmacological methods and intracellular recordings in motoneurons from an adult frog’s isolated spinal cord, we aimed to identify the 5-HT receptor subtype responsible for inhibiting the release of glycine. Аn agonist of 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, and a selective agonist of 5-HT2 receptors, α-Ме-5-НТ, did not show any significant effect on inhibitory transmission, indicating that 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT7 receptors are not involved in the modulation of glycine release in the adult frog spinal cord. An agonist of 5-HT1B/D receptors sumatriptan decreased the frequency (but not the amplitude) of glycinergic mIPSPs similar to 5-HT. An antagonist of 5-HT1,2 receptors, methysergide, abolished the effect of sumatriptan. Together our results suggest that 5-HT inhibits the release of glycine by activation of 5-HT1B/D receptors."
High-Rate STBC Communication System Using Imperfect CSI Under Time-Selective Flat-Fading Environment,"In this paper, a high-rate space-time block-coded (STBC) mobile communication system using imperfect channel-state-information (CSI) is presented, which is working over the time-selective flat-fading wireless channels. In the work, a flat-fading channel is modelled as a first-order Markov-process, taking into account Doppler shifts and carrier frequency offsets. The STBC data-rate 5/4 with two-transmitter antennas is attained by maximizing the coding gain and by minimizing the transmitted signal peak-to-minimum-power-ratio, while using the selective power scaling in combination with quadrature-phase-shift-keying digital modulation technique. The time-selective nature of underlying channel leads to reduction in the diversity gain, though optimum power scaling factor is incorporated. However, imperfect CSI usually arises due to the availability of noisy channel estimates at the receiver, which causes system performance degradation. Simulation results are presented to illustrate that the effective throughput in terms of frame-error-rate or symbol-error-rate of the presented data-rate \({5 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {5 4}} \right. \kern-0pt} 4}\) STBC system is adversely affected because of the noisy channel estimates. But, an efficient channel estimator helps in combating the time-selectivity of channel, and in turn results in effective throughput improvement under the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions only. Subsequently, the data-rate \({9 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {9 8}} \right. \kern-0pt} 8}\) STBC system with four-transmitter antennas is explored using similar strategy working over the time-nonselective (time-varying) flat-fading channels, which performs well under the high SNR and low channel estimation noise/error conditions."
A Short-Term Power Load Prediction Algorithm of Based on Power Load Factor Deep Cluster Neural Network,"Accurate short-term prediction of power system load is of great importance to improvement of power system’s stability and electrical equipment’s safety, and a critical step for power load prediction is clustering of existing historical information of load. Since load itself is a time series data with high dimensionality, and meanwhile, load is influenced by meteorological factors and seasonal factors, as a result it’s difficult to establish simple linear relationships with the load and these factors, and consequently, the clustering quality obtained by traditional algorithms is low, which further affects quality of load prediction. Deep learning algorithm was introduced in this paper to construct a power load factor deep cluster neural network (PLDCNN) which consisted of multi-group neural network. Station operating data for consecutive 3 years were introduced in the simulation experiment. PLDCNN was compared with traditional clustering algorithms, and experiment indicated that PLDCNN could describe and classify power load information more accurately, and short-term load prediction of electric power system based on PLDCNN could also archive higher accuracy."
A Modified Fractional-Order Unscented Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Fractional-Order Systems,"In this paper, a fractional-order unscented Kalman filter (FUKF) is introduced at first. Then, its convergence is analyzed based on Lyapunov functions for nonlinear fractional-order systems. Specific conditions are obtained that guarantee the boundedness of the FUKF estimation error. In addition, an adaptive noise covariance is suggested to overcome huge estimation errors. Since the adaptation law plays a crucial role in the performance of the proposed method, a fuzzy logic based method is also presented to improve the adaptive noise covariance. Therefore, a modified FUKF is proposed to increase the convergence and the accuracy of the estimation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented to estimate the states of a two electric pendulum system and its performance is analyzed. Simulation results show that a huge estimation error leads to the FUKF divergence; however, the modified fractional-order unscented Kalman filter with fuzzy performs an accurate state estimation."
Explanatory analysis of the key factors in an energy sustainability index,"The need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in energy generation has led to international and national bodies recommending and encouraging a series of policies and measures to boost so-called green energy generation and achieve sustainability in the energy sector. In order to assess the energy sustainability path of countries worldwide, we first propose a dynamic analysis of an energy sustainability index (ESI) based on the methodology of composite indicators built on a large dataset of 136 heterogeneous countries and 38 variables observed in 3 years (2000, 2005 and 2011). Second, to isolate the influence of socio-demographic and economic characteristics on the energy sustainability of countries, we perform quantile regression with clustered data. Our findings demonstrate that major changes are required in developing countries, where development is pursued mainly through the use of energy sources based on fossil fuels. To ensure access to sustainable energy, policy makers need to consider and improve the key factors according to the ESI’s quantiles. In particular, human development variables (i.e., life expectancy and the percentage of completed secondary schooling attained in the population) and the variables related to civil rights and institutions (e.g., percentage of women in national parliaments) are crucial in promoting energy sustainability. By contrast, high unemployment rates, high congestion costs and the continued use of highly polluting energy sources have the effect of reducing energy sustainability."
Efficacy and safety of interferon alpha for essential thrombocythemia during pregnancy: two cases and a literature review,"For pregnant women with essential thrombocythemia (ET), no standard approach for managing the platelet count has been established. We present the cases of two pregnant women with ET treated with interferon (IFN)-alpha. Each case showed a marked platelet decrease, from values within normal limits at the time of delivery, with no severe adverse events. To clarify the efficacy and safely of IFN alpha for ET during pregnancy, we performed a literature review. A total of 43 pregnant women with ET were ultimately identified from 12 articles and the present cases. IFN-alpha therapy decreased platelet counts to normal levels at birth in many cases, and there were no adverse events that required the discontinuation of IFN-alpha treatment. Overall, 93% of pregnant women with ET gave birth to healthy babies. We consider that, given its efficacy and safety, IFN-alpha therapy is a reasonable treatment option for pregnant women with ET."
Experimental study and mathematical model to follow the spreading diameter on coated woven cotton fabric,"This paper presents an experimental study of the liquid drop spreading in porous media. The spreading phenomenon is being investigated for various applications including the textile ink jet printing. In this study, drop-spreading experiments were carried out with ink solution on virgin glass plate, film of coating paste and on coated woven fabric with different emport rate and two drying temperature. The drop-spreading behavior was examined by measuring the contact diameter, the height and the volume of the drop along the time. Then, mathematical model was has been put in to evaluate and quantify the spreading phenomenon. It was concluded that the drop shape has two phases where the spreading governs the drop profile in first time and the evaporation controls it at long times. Thus, the drop-spreading was deeply affected by the drying temperature of coating paste and the woven fabric structure where the mentioned phases have been influenced. Moreover, to evaluate the spreading phenomenon, a mathematical model was put in. It presents high conformity with the experimental results, so it could constitute a prototype of the industry of ink jet printing."
Synthesis and application of phthalimide disperse dyes,"Three azo dyes had been synthesized using N-propyl substituted, dibromo-substituted and dicyano-substituted phthalimides as diazo components. All of the synthesized intermediates and dyes have been characterized by MS, 1H-NMR and IR analyses. The dyeing behaviour and fastness properties of these dyes had been investigated. The absorption maxima of the dyes were observed in the range 360 to 700 nm. The results indicated that dyes caused hypsochromism effect after -Br substitution and dyes caused bathochromism effect after -CN substitution. IR spectra of hydrolyzed dye showed that C=O groups appeared under relatively mild alkaline conditions. Compared with electron density, steric hindrance effect is an more important influence factor than electron density in hydrolysis reaction process. Exhaustion of dyed polyester/elastane fabrics decreased obviously as the pH value increased. In order to ensure dyeing levelness, heating rate of prepared dyes will be strictly controlled. Due to alkali-clearable property and interaction energy of dye-fiber and dye-dye, the dyes have good colorfastness."
Structural characterization of LbL assembled multilayers by using different polyelectrolytes on cotton fabrics,"An alternative approach to application of chitosan based on layer by layer (LbL) assembled technique is studied in this paper. For this aim, chitosan (CHT) was used as a bio-based cationic polyelectrolyte and pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) were selected as anionic polyelectrolyte. TPP/CHT and PSS/CHT based bilayers were fabricated on the cationized woven cotton fabrics via layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The characterization of coatings on the fabric surface in terms of surface appearance, atomal content, and chemical bondings were made in detail through SEM, XPS, and FTIR-ATR analysis. Also, the antibacterial activity, air permeability, and water contact angle were measured. Surface analyses demonstrate the interaction between TPP, PSS and chitosan separately. XPS spectra also showed the existence of LbL deposition over cotton substrates in terms of both elemental composition and the presence of different types of bondings on the fabric surface. The antibacterial activity analysis revealed that the modified cotton fabric with the addition of CHT/TPP and CHT/PSS bilayers could increase the degree of inhibition on K. pneumanie and S. aureus bacteria."
Reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol over sonoimmobilized silver/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites on polyester fabric,"The current paper is aimed to compare different arrangement of Ag nanoparticles within silver/reduced graphene oxide (Ag/rGO) nanocomposites on the polyester fabric. rGO sheets cannot be dispersed in the water for long time however, thin layer surfactant-free Ag/rGO nanocomposites were immobilized on the surface of polyester. This leads to attain the preserved array of nanocomposites for a long time. TEM, FESEM/EDX, XRD, XPS, cyclic voltammetry, catalytic activity and electrical resistivity were used to characterize Ag/rGO nanocomposites coated polyester fabric. Interestingly, sonoimmobilization of Ag/GO produced an even coating layer of nanocomposites on the polyester fabric. The prepared fabric can be used as a high active and stable nanocatalyst for reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in water at room temperature. The created flexible and light fabric showed low electrical resistance and high catalytic activity, wherein sonoimmobilization of Ag/rGO treated samples indicated highest catalytic activity as 4-NP solution completely reduced to 4- AP with assistance of 2×4 cm2 treated polyester after 25 min. On the other hand, introducing sonoprepared silver nanoparticles among graphene nanosheets led to significant lowering of electrical resistivity from 43 kΩ/square in mechanical stirring methodto 2 kΩ/square using ultrasound."
Functional electrospun cellulosic nanofiber mats for antibacterial bandages,"Functionalization of cellulosic nanofibers was established to develop antibacterial bandages. The functionalization was conducted through preparation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) containing different metal nanoparticles (MNPs) such as copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) and zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs). Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize CMC containing MNPs and scanning electron microscopy coupled with high energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) to study the surface morphology of CMC with and without MNPs. Furthermore, back scattering electron detector was used to show the position of metal nanoparticles on the microcrystalline CMC. In addition, UV-visible spectroscopy was used to confirm MNPs formation. Nanofiber mats of CMC containing MNPs were synthesized using electrospinning technique. Surface morphology of electrospun CMC containing MNPs was characterized using SEM. The obtained data revealed that elctrospun CMC nanofibers containing MNPs were smooth and uniformly distributed without bead formation. The average fiber diameters were in the range of 150 to 200 nm and the presence of MNPs in the nanofiber did not affect the size of the electrospun nanofiber diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed that MNPs were existed inside and over the surface of the electrospun nanofibers without any agglomeration. The average particle diameters of MNPs were 29-39 nm for ZnNPs, 23-27 nm for CuNPs and 22-26 nm for FeNPs. Moreover, Water uptake of electrospun nanofiber mats and the release of MNPs from nanofibers were evaluated. Nevertheless, electrospun CMC nanofibers containing MNPs had an excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus."
Fabrication of structure-preserving monodisperse particles of PMMA-grafted fullerenes,"Fullerene has fascinated characteristics and the fabrication of fullerene-containing assembly of high solubility in general solvents at facile way is immensely expected for the material processing. We aimed to control supramolecular structure of fullerene-containing molecules with arrested morphology, which would boost material potentials to wider application. In this study, we have synthesized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-grafted fullerene and the association behavior of PMMA-grafted fullerene in solvent is utilized to obtain monodisperse assemblies with submicron size. Furthermore, we have succeeded to fix the assembly morphology by UV irradiation and recovered the assembly in another solvent in which the assembly basically does not form. This procedure enables us to obtain fullerene- dispersed materials at sub-μm order with various matrixes."
Directly-prelithiated carbon nanotube film for high-performance flexible lithium-ion battery electrodes,"Carbon nanotube (CNT) films are very flexible and serve as active materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Hence, they have high potential as flexible free-standing electrodes for wearable batteries. However, nanocarbon materials such as CNTs and graphene are of limited use as electrodes because they have a large initial irreversible capacity due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we prelithiated the CNT films to make them available as electrodes for flexible batteries by reducing their irreversible capacity. The SEI is pre-formed through a direct prelithiation (DP) method that brings lithium metal into direct contact with CNT films in an electrolyte. As a result, the capacity of directly-prelithiated CNT film electrodes continues to increase to 1520 mAh/g until 350th cycle of charge/discharge and their initial irreversible capacity vanishes.

Preparation of electrospun affinity membrane and cross flow system for dynamic removal of anionic dye from colored wastewater,"In this research, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/chitosan electrospun nanofibrous membrane (ENM) was prepared by electrospinning method in order to investigate its dye removal ability from colored wastewater. The morphology and average fiber diameter of the membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemical characterization was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The permeability of the membranes was evaluated by measuring pure water flux (PWF). In order to investigate the performance of the prepared membranes they were used in the batch adsorption and membrane separation for dye removal from colored wastewater. The effect of pH, number of membranes and dye concentration on the dye removal ability of the ENM was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to achieve multi-objective optimization and equations of adsorption capacity and breakthrough time regarding operating conditions. The results demonstrated the potential of using PVA/chitosan nanofiber membrane as a microfiltration (MF) membrane for dye removal. Moreover, the recoverability property of prepared membranes was noticeable."
Synergistic UV-curable flame-retardant finish of cotton using comonomers of vinylphosphonic acid and acrylamide,"While ‘Pyrovatex’ and’ Proban’ processes have been widely used for durable flame-retardant finishing of cotton, the flame retardants could release formaldehyde inevitably during or even after the finishing process, which is not environmentally compatible. As a new formaldehyde-free flame retardant and finishing process, the comonomers of vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) and acrylamide (AAm) can be in situ copolymerized upon LED-UV irradiation and impart excellent flame retardancy to the cotton. The increasing AAm addition enhanced fixation, flame retardancy effectivity and synergistic effectiveness by reducing the steric hindrance between the VPA monomers during the copolymerization. Also the multifunctional crosslinkers of either methylene bisacrylamide or triacryloylhexahydro triazine significantly improved the laundering durability of the finished fabrics. The increased char formation and residue number after pyrolysis indicated the solid-phase retarding mechanism of the synergistic VPA and AAm combination."
Basalt nanoparticle reinforced hybrid woven composites: Mechanical and thermo-mechanical performance,"Nanoparticles are gaining wider importance and increasing utility in many areas of engineering and technology. This investigative work is conducted to study the effect of incorporating basalt nano particles in composites with basalt/basalt and basalt/jute woven structures as reinforcement. The nanoparticles were developed from basalt, they were characterized and used for reinforcing composites of basalt and jute hybrid fabrics. The mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hybrid woven basalt reinforced epoxy composites were evaluated. Microscopic examination was carried out in order to analyze the internal structure and fractured surfaces. Interfacial characteristics, material morphology and failure was studied by use of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and optical microscopy. Thermal stability was characterized by TGA. The results elaborated that the incorporation of basalt nanoparticles exhibited superior properties compared to the pure epoxy resin impregnated basalt fabric reinforced composites in terms of mechanical and thermal stability."
Comparison of a time- and a speed-based traffic light assistance system,"Traffic light assistance systems (TLASs) can be infrastructure based or on-board, and in the latter case they can inform the driver about the time remaining to green, or about the recommended speed for a smooth passage at green. A speed-based and a time-based on-board system prototype was compared against each other and against a baseline without any assistance system. Using a within-subjects design, 18 participants drove in a fixed-base simulator along a suburban road with signalised intersections, where the delay to green was set to zero (allowing a passage at the current speed), “half-speed” (requiring a clear speed reduction) and “stop” (requiring a substantial speed reduction). Driving behaviour, visual attention distribution and acceptance were evaluated. Both support systems improved driving efficiency and comfort over baseline, with the time-based system achieving higher scores in general. Both systems attracted a substantial amount of visual attention in the current setting; however, single-glance durations were below 1 s, and the number of glances forward were equal in the time-based condition compared to baseline, but lower in the speed-based condition. No red or amber light violations were registered in baseline, while some occurred with any of the systems. Acceptance for both systems was high, with higher scores for the time-based prototype. Overall, an on-board TLAS with a countdown timer to green has the potential to increase efficiency and comfort without strong indications for attention disruption, but the risk for increased red/amber light violations has to be addressed. Improved system design as a way to mitigate potential issues is discussed."
Accelerating SCA compliance testing with advanced development tools,"In this article, we explore the potential for combining model-based development environments supporting automatic code generation with novel static testing technology to accelerate the SCA compliance testing process. Model-based development and automated testing yield higher regularity and predictability, reducing testing complexity and sidestepping some issues for software intended for deployment on multiple hardware platforms. Further, integrating test tools into the development environment can provide immediate feedback on compliance issues during the development process. As testing moves upstream, the load on certification entities is reduced, and correction of issues becomes more straightforward. Pushing the testing upstream also opens the door to increased customization. We introduce Pitchfork, a language technology that allows users to define specifications as sequences of patterns that can be identified in source code. With Pitchfork, it becomes possible to encapsulate SCA and other properties in a precise, automatically checkable way and distribute them across the SDR community for immediate integration. A natural evolution of this concept is self-certification, in which a robust set of test tools provides a capability for a developer to offer strong evidence of compliance without a formal certification process. Our conclusions are supported with experiences from the use of the \(\hbox {NordiaSoft}^{\mathrm{TM}}\) SCA Architect IDE and Reservoir Labs’ R-Check\(^{\copyright }\) SCA compliance test tool."
Diversity of moderate El Niño events evolution: role of air–sea interactions in the eastern tropical Pacific,"In this paper we investigate the evolution of moderate El Niño events during their developing phase with the objective to understand why some of them did not evolve as extreme events despite favourable conditions for the non-linear amplification of the Bjerknes feedback (i.e. warm SST in Austral winter in the eastern equatorial Pacific). Among the moderate events, two classes are considered consisting in the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño events and Central Pacific (CP) events. We first show that the observed SST variability across moderate El Niño events (i.e. inter-event variability) is largest in the far eastern Pacific (east of ~ 130°W) in the Austral winter prior to their peak, which is associated to either significant warm anomaly (moderate EP El Niño) or an anomaly between weak warm and cold (moderate CP El Niño) as reveals by the EOF analysis of the SST anomaly evolution during the development phase of El Niño across the El Niño years. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of SST and wind stress anomalies across the El Niño years further indicates that the inter-event SST variability is associated with an air–sea mode explaining 31% of the covariance between SST and wind stress. The associated SST pattern consists in SST anomalies developing along the coast of Ecuador in Austral fall and expanding westward as far as 130°W in Austral winter. The associated wind stress pattern features westerlies (easterlies) west of ~ 130°W along the equator peaking around June–August for EP (CP) El Niño events. This air–sea mode is interpreted as resulting from a developing seasonal Bjerknes feedback for EP El Niño events since it is shown to be associated to a Kelvin wave response at its peak phase. However equatorial easterlies east of 130°W emerge in September that counters the growing SST anomalies associated to the air–sea mode. These have been particularly active during both the 1972 and the 2015 El Niño events. It is shown that the easterlies are connected to an off-equatorial southerly wind off the coast of Peru and Ecuador. The southerly wind is a response to the coastal SST anomalies off Peru developing from Austral fall. Implications of our results for the understanding of the seasonal ENSO dynamics and diversity are discussed in the light of the analysis of two global climate models simulating realistically ENSO diversity (GFDL_CM2.1 and CESM)."
Sialendoscopy in treatment of adult chronic recurrent parotitis without sialolithiasis,"The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of sialendoscopy in the management of adult chronic recurrent parotitis without sialolithiasis. In addition, preliminary results of an initial randomized placebo-controlled trial of single-dose intraductal steroid injection given concurrently with sialendoscopy, are presented."
The role of venture capitalist to enhance the growth of Spanish and Italian university spin-offs,"The establishment of spin-offs to commercialise university knowledge/technology is a potential mechanism to promote economic and innovative development. Nevertheless, University Spin-Offs (USOs) are usually resource-constrained, especially in obtaining funding, limiting their growth. Venture Capital (VC) investors play an important role in the financing and the improvement of their managerial skills, which are critical for firm growth. This paper aims to explore both the effect of VC partners on the USOs’ growth and the cross-national differences in the role played by them. To study both issues, we empirically analysed 516 Spanish and 904 Italian USOs created by 50 Spanish and 57 Italian universities, respectively, and observed them between 2005 and 2013. The results showed different effects in the Spanish and Italian cases. While in Spain the presence of VC partners positively affects the USOs’ growth, in Italy there is not a significant effect. This evidence calls for systematic policies by public administrations and universities to foster USO growth."
The use of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure during laparoscopic hysterectomy,To compare surgical outcomes and complications of 334 women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy with or without the use of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure.
Bond Supply and Excess Bond Returns in Zero-Lower Bound and Normal Environments: Evidence from Japan,"We estimate a discrete-time version of the Vayanos and Vila (2009) preferred-habitat model, using Japanese government bond yield data. The estimated results indicate that bond excess returns become more sensitive to bond supply in the absence of a zero lower bound constraint unless arbitrageurs become willing to take on more risk."
Intergenerational Wealth Elasticity in Japan,"This study estimates the intergenerational wealth elasticity using original Japanese survey data and assesses factors explaining the intergenerational wealth elasticity, such as income, educational level, bequests and preferences. The age-adjusted elasticity of child wealth with respect to parental wealth ranges from 0.266 to 0.367, and transition matrices indicate that the intergenerational transmission of wealth persists more strongly in the tails of the distributions. The correlation between parent and child wealth mainly stems from income, education and bequests, which jointly constitute 63.9% of the wealth elasticity."
How Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Influence the Defense System of Sunflower During Different Abiotic Stresses,"The association between terrestrial plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is one of the most common and widespread mutualistic plant-fungi interaction. AM fungi are of beneficial effects on the water and nutrient uptake of plants and increase plant defense mechanisms to alleviate different stresses. The aim of this study was to determine the level of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), guaiacol peroxidase (POX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activities and to track the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal system under temperature- and mechanical stress conditions. Our results suggest that induced tolerance of mycorrhizal sunflower to high temperature may be attributed to the induction of GST, POX and PPO enzyme activities as well as to the elevated expression of GST. However, the degree of tolerance of the plant is significantly influenced by the age which is probably justified by the energy considerations."
In silico Characterisation of Novel Rice Transcripts Differentially Expressed in Phosphorus Deficient Conditions Suggests a Role of These Transcripts in Multiple Abiotic Stresses,"Phosphorus deficiency adversely affects crop productivity. The mechanism of tolerance in plants is not well understood. The current study successfully annotated a set of highly significant (Log2 RPKM ≥3) nine novel sequences up-regulated in P deficient condition identified from a low P tolerant rice genotype. Sequence annotation identified two transcripts (Os01g37260 and Os02g11060) carrying known domains, F-box and WD, respectively. Multiple Expectation maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) revealed presence of conserved domains like D[LP][HY][CL]D[CM][DT]C[AP][DQ][IQ]C, [EH][DN]HN[HS] [ER][FY][EP]I[HN]H which might play a role in phosphorus deficiency tolerance. Analysis of the upstream regions indicated presence of stress responsive elements like E Box, ABRE, and MYBCORE suggesting regulation of the novel transcripts by DNA binding. Protein localization prediction tool suggests that these novel proteins might be targeted to nucleus, chloroplast and cell wall. Transcripts Os02g03640 and Os02g10250 revealed potential target sites for microRNA binding suggesting role of novel miRNAs in low phosphorus response. Our analysis suggests that an F-box protein, Os01g37260 (OSFBx14) might be a promising candidate gene playing a role in multiple abiotic stresses including P deficiency."
Chemical Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of the Commercial Origanum onites L. Oil Against Nosocomial Carbapenem Resistant Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producer Escherichia coli Isolates,"In recent years rapidly growing antibiotic resistance has increased interest toward natural products, especially essential oils because of their various effects. The aim of this study was to identify the chemical composition of the commercial Origanum onites essential oil (EO) and to investigate the antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and dilution methods, against ten different ATCC strains, including eight bacteria, two yeasts and seventy-nine clinical nosocomial Escherichia coli isolates that produce extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The chemical composition of EO was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The major compounds of the EO were determined as carvacrol (51.4%) followed by linalool (11.2%), p-cymene (8.9%) and γ-terpinene (6.7%). O. onites EO had antimicrobial activity against all standard strains and inhibited microbial growth of ESBL positive E. coli isolates. According to our results, O. onites EO may be an alternative to synthetic drug, used in combination with other antibiotics for treatment of infection caused by multidrug resistant bacteria after testing toxic effects and irritation at preferred doses on human."
In vivo Screening of Diterpene Alkaloids using Bdelloid Rotifer Assays,"The group of diterpene alkaloids contains numerous compounds with complex chemistry and diverse pharmacological activities. Beside toxicity, these compounds possess activity on the cardiovascular system, tumor cell lines and nervous system. The pharmacological properties have been described using in vitro and in vivo techniques; however, the bioactivities of many compounds have not thoroughly been studied. Here we report on the in vivo evaluation of ten diterpene alkaloids using bdelloid rotifer assays. Napelline exerted toxic effects on rotifers, while wide tolerance range was observed for other investigated compounds. Weak toxicity of songorine is supported by our experiment. Toxicological data for senbusine A, senbusine C, septentrioidine and hetisinone are reported for the first time."
FISH Karyotype of 85 Common Wheat Cultivars/Lines Displayed by ND-FISH Using Oligonucleotide Probes,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can reveal minor structural differences of chromosomes. The karyotype of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based on FISH pattern is seldom reported. In this study, non-denaturing FISH (ND-FISH) using Oligo-pSc119.2-1, Oligo-pTa535-1 and (AAG)6 as probes was used to investigate the chromosomal structure of 85 common wheat including 83 wheat-rye 1RS.1BL translocation cultivars/lines, a wheatrye 1RS.1AL translocation cultivar Amigo and Chinese Spring (CS). Two, three, two, three, six, three and four structural types respectively for 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A and 7A chromosomes were observed. Two, eight, two, two, four and six types of chromosome for 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B and 7B were respectively detected. The structure of 1B chromosomes in Amigo and CS is different. Five, two, two and two types of chromosomal structure respectively for 1D, 2D, 3D and 5D were distinguished. Polymorphisms of 1RS.1BL, 4D, 6D and 7D chromosomes were not detected. Chromosomes 1AI, 2AI, 3AI, 4AI, 5AIII, 6AI, 7AIII, 2BI, 3BV, 4BI, 5BII, 6BIII, 7BI, 1DIV, 2DI, 3DI and 5DII appeared in these 85 wheat cultivars/lines at high frequency. Each of the 85 wheat cultivars/lines has a unique karyotype. Amigo is a complex translocation cultivar. The FISH karyotype of wheat chromosomes built in this study provide a reference for the future analyzing wheat genetic stocks and help to learn structural variations of wheat chromosomes. In addition, the results in this study indicate that oligonucleotide probes and ND-FISH technology can be used to identify individual wheat cultivar."
Relations between tree canopy composition and understorey vegetation in a European beech-sessile oak old growth forest in Western Romania,"The diversity relationship between tree and herb layer has often been investigated, but the results are contradictory. Moreover, few studies of deciduous European species have been conducted to date in natural or near-natural forests, while such studies in old-growth forest with considerable co-dominance of oak are missing."
Antimicrobial properties of 6-pentyl-α-pyrone produced by endophytic strains of Trichoderma koningii and its effect on aflatoxin B1 production,"A total of 60 endophytic fungal strains were isolated and screened for their producing-ability of 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6PP), which has a coconut-like aroma. Of these isolated strains, four strains of Trichoderma koningii Oudemans were positive for 6PP production. Agar well diffusion assay was employed to test the antimicrobial activity of 6PP against 22 microbial strains. Although 6PP showed no antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains, it interestingly exhibited positive inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus recording a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 μg/mL. The 6PP displayed a good antifungal activity against all filamentous fungi tested with MICs ranged from 80 to 90 μg.mL. To demonstrate its mode of antimicrobial activity, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium expansum and Fusarium acuminatum were treated with 6PP at sub-MICs and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Several morphological alterations were caused by 6PP, such as induction of a bleb-like structure on the outer surface of the treated bacteria and surface depression with loosing hyphal linearity of the treated fungi. Additionally, several extensive cellular damages were also observed in microbial cells and the most frequent alteration noticed was the detachment of plasma membrane from cell wall. The inhibitory activity of 6PP was further demonstrated on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by several strains of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus grown in liquid medium and results showed that 6PP had a good efficacy in suppression of AFB1 by 34.28–54.63%. These findings hold a promise to control pathogenic organisms and their toxicity using a lactone metabolite."
"Effect of NaCl stress on physiological, antioxidant enzymes and anatomical responses of Astragalus gombiformis","The current study was carried out to check the influence of the gradient saline (0, 50, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM NaCl) on Astragalus gombiformis Pomel. plants grown in pots in greenhouse conditions. The results demonstrated that salt levels above 50 mM substantially reduced the biomass accumulation in both roots and especially in shoots. Similarly, higher salinity (100–300 mM NaCl) resulted significant decline in net photosynthetic (-66.2%), transpiration (-80%), stomatal conductance (-87.7%), intercellular CO2 concentration (-78.1%) and chlorophyll a and b contents (-45.7 and -51%, respectively). Also, leaf relative water content (RWC) was reduced significantly with salinity exceeding 100 mM NaCl, while the leaf water potential (ΨW) decreased significantly as salinity rises. Salt stress increases Na+, Na+/K+ and decreases K+ concentrations in all tissues of A. gombiformis. Compensatory, an accumulation of organic osmolytes such as soluble sugars in response to higher salinity (150–300 mM NaCl) was observed, while proline content increased drastically with progressive salinity. The present study reveals that GPX and GR were highly used to protect from NaCl-induced H2O2. APX might to participate efficiently in restriction of oxidative damages under higher salinity (50–150 mM). The leaf anatomy showed an increase in upper epidermal thickness at higher salt level (300 mM), whereas the total leaf thickness and the mesophyll parenchyma area decreased with salinity exceeding 100 mM NaCl. The distance between vascular bundle and the xylem vessel diameter were reduced only at 300 mM. The stomatal density decreased with enhanced stomata size at 200–300 mM NaCl. Based on these physiological, biochemical and anatomical responses to salinity we conclude that A. gombiformis is unable to maintain the ionic homeostasis and to managing ROS stress at high salinity and therefore can tolerate only mild to moderate salinity."
Effects of roads and adjacent areas on diversity of terrestrial isopods of Hungarian highway verges,"Transportation infrastructure may be the most important driver of social and economic development, but it is a major cause of environmental change in landscapes. The main objective of this paper is to report road edge effects on isopods of Hungarian highway verges. We examined the isopod diversity along five highways (M0, M1, M3, M5, M7) while accounting for road edge proximity and the adjacent areas. Double-glass pitfall traps were set in a total of 15 sites and at three distances from the edge of the roads next to different types of adjacent areas. We found differences between ecological parameters of isopod communities in relation to adjacent areas as well as to road edge proximity. The highest diversity was observed near urban areas, while the lowest was near the arable fields. Isopod diversity increased with decreasing distance from a road. Species diversity of different types of verges based on adjacent areas varied strongly in relation to road edge proximity. A medium distance (40 m) from roads had a positive effect on species richness, while verges next to arable fields were the most species-rich habitats. The general conclusion of this study is that highway verges provided suitable environment conditions for generalist isopod species but may be a limiting factor for specialist isopods. Moreover, highway verges function as corridors for isopods. The proximity of roads and urban areas positively affected isopods, and verges close to roads and urban areas are considered as an attractive environment for isopods in heterogeneous roadside verges."
Determining the trophic linkage of the red-crowned crane Grus japonensis in Zhalong wetland in northeastern China,"The trophic relations of the red-crowned crane in Zhalong wetland, northeastern China may significantly be altered due to the rapid decrease in accessible food resources. To confirm this hypothesis, we determined the trophic status of this vulnerable species by using stable isotope (carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) methods. The δ13Cand 15Nsignatures in the red-crowned crane species were in the range of −17.8‰to −18.5‰and 6.9‰to 8.1‰, respectively. The majority of the ecosystem of Zhalong wetland has an average food-chain length of 3.9, and the trophic level of the examined species, i.e., red-crowned crane, was approximately 3.1. The trophic relations of red-crowned cranes have changed over the period of 2004 to 2014, as the biological species in the bottom trophic level significantly exhausted in the past years. The conflict of food demand by red-crowned cranes versus the livelihood demand of local wetland residents should be resolved to ensure sustainability of food supply sustainable for rare and extinguishable species."
Dual-Wavelength Thin-Layer Chromatographic—Densitometric Determination of Febuxostat in Combination with Acetaminophen in Synthetic Mixture and in Pharmaceutical Formulations,"The combination of xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat (FBX) with acetaminophen (ACE) is widely used in the treatment of gout. A rapid, simple, selective, and precise densitometric method was developed and validated for the simultaneous estimation of FBX—ACE mixture in a synthetic binary mixture and in their pharmaceutical dosage forms. The method employed thin-layer chromatography (TLC) aluminum plates precoated with silica gel G 60 F254 as the stationary phase using chloroform—methanol—cyclohexane—acetic acid 96% (7:1:1:0.1, v/v) as the mobile phase. The optimized mobile phase selected for development gave compact bands (RFvalues were 0.65 and 0.46 for FBX and ACE, respectively). Spectrodensitometric scanning integration was performed using dual-wavelength detection at 320 and 250 nm for FBX and ACE, respectively. The linear regression data for the calibration plots showed excellent linear relationship (r = 0.9997 and 0.9992 for FBX and ACE, respectively). The method was validated for precision, accuracy, robustness, and recovery. The limits of detection and quantification were calculated. The statistical analysis proved that the method is reproducible and selective for the estimation of this binary mixture."

Heat recovery of dedusting systems in electric arc furnaces: concept of a bottoming cogeneration plant and techno-economic analysis,"Steelworks require large amount of energy in reduction, fusion and refining processes. A mini-mill is a steelwork that produces steel by melting scrap metal, pig iron and metallic elements in electric arc furnaces. Depending on the desired product, the refining process requires vacuum degassing to remove contaminant gases from the liquid steel. The vacuum in the degassing process can be obtained through steam ejectors, which use superheated steam. Furthermore, environmental legislation requires mini-mills to have dedusting systems over the electric furnaces. In general, a dedusting system generates high flow rates of hot off-gases, which indicates an interesting potential for heat recovering. In this paper, a cogeneration plant to recover heat from the dedusting system of a Brazilian mini-mill is proposed. The actual operation data are considered to calculate the heat available and to conceptualize a bottoming cogeneration plant that generates electric power and superheated steam for the ejectors of the degassing process. Results show that the proposed plant can generate 45.4% of the steam required by the ejectors and up to 2.4% of the power required by the electric arc furnace. Also, the heat recovering from the dedusting system reduces the use of cooling water by 29.3%. From an economic viewpoint, the cogeneration plant decreased the expenses for power, steam and cooling water by 1.5, 32 and 29%, respectively. Overall, there was an expense reduction of 4.8%, resulting in a payback period of 4.1 years in the case base. For a projected best case scenario, the payback period is about 2.3 years."
RF characteristics of flexible circuits patterned with hybrid Ag paste,"Printed electronics based on nanomaterials has been a potential alternative to conventional electronic technology and is favorable for flexible polymer substrates. However, a printed circuit has insufficient electrical performance and mechanical reliability under flexible stress. We designed hybrid Ag pastes containing Ag nanoparticles (NPs, 30–50 nm) and Ag flake (F, 2.5–3.5 μm in diameter) particles to overcome the obstacles of printed electronics. Six types of Ag paste (Ag NPs-x wt% F paste, x = 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100) were screen-printed onto a polyimide substrate and sintered at 200 °C for fabricating a flexible circuit. We simulated a coplanar waveguide pattern before measuring the S-parameter using high frequency structural simulation. To investigate the radio frequency characteristics of various Ag circuits under sliding stress, a network analyzer and Cascade’s probe system in the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz were employed before and after 100,000 sliding cycles. Hybrid Ag circuits showed stable electrical conductance and signal transmission, while pure Ag particle circuits showed a definite drop of electrical conductance (over 30% increase of electrical resistance) under cyclic sliding stress. The microstructural crack behavior demonstrated that the Ag F content within the Ag hybrid circuits effectively suppressed crack propagation, leading to improved flexibility of the sintered Ag circuit."
Microwave dielectric properties of high Q and temperature stable Li3(Mg1−xNix)2NbO6 ceramics,"In this paper, the Li3(Mg1−xNix)2NbO6 (0.02 ≦ x ≦ 0.08) ceramics are prepared by a solid state reaction method. The effects of Ni2+ substitution on the microwave dielectric properties, microstructure and sintering properties are investigated systematically. The XRD patterns reveal that all the samples could form solid solution with a single Li3Mg2NbO6 phase in the sintering process. The variation in Q × f values is similar to that in bulk density, and tremendous improvement of Q × f values could be attributed to bigger grains and high densification. Since the more polarizable Mg2+ ion is replaced by the less polarizable Ni2+ ion, the permittivities decrease almost linearly with increasing Ni2+ content. Otherwise, with the x value increase from 0.02 to 0.08, the τ
f
 values could be effectively adjusted to near zero, but the decreasing porosity-corrected permittivities would damage the stability of crystal structure, which make the τ
f
 values shift toward the negative direction. In general, the Li3(Mg0.96Ni0.04)2NbO6 ceramics sintered at 1175 °C for 6 h exhibit superior microwave dielectric properties of εr ~ 15.22, Q × f ~ 126,784 GHz, τ
f
 ~ − 2.63 ppm/°C, which demonstrate that the ceramics could be selected as a promising low loss and temperature stable material for future application."
Conventional and transgenic strategies to enhance the acid soil tolerance of barley,"The aluminum (Al3+) tolerance of barley cultivars predominately from Brazil was compared to that of cultivars from other countries, wild barley accessions, and a transgenic line (L5) over-expressing TaALMT1, the major Al3+ tolerance gene from wheat. After screening conventional germplasm for Al3+ tolerance in hydroponics, 18 genotypes were further characterized in a short-term soil experiment. Among the Brazilian cultivars, Antarctica 01 and BRS Mariana showed the greatest relative root length (RRL) in acid soil. However, these cultivars were significantly less tolerant than the foreign cultivars Dayton (USA) and Murasakimochi (Japan) and the transgenic line L5 which out-performed all conventional genotypes. In long-term growth trials, the transgenic line produced the greatest relative root and relative shoot dry weight. Relative grain yield was greatest in the transgenic line and Dayton. All genotypes were also scored for two genetic markers linked to HvAACT1, the major Al3+ tolerance gene in barley. One marker detects a 1-kb insertion in the promoter that increases gene expression and leads to increased Al3+-activated citrate efflux from root apices. The other marker detects a 21-bp indel downstream of the coding region. The 1-kb insertion was only detected in Dayton and Murasakimochi that were the best performing cultivars among the non-transgenic germplasm. Interestingly, the Brazilian cultivars with an intermediate level of tolerance, Antarctica 01 and BRS Mariana, lacked the 1-kb insertion but had enhanced HvAACT1 expression compared to an Al3+-sensitive cultivar. No clear correlation was observed between Al3+ tolerance and the 21-bp indel marker in the short-term soil trials. We conclude that improved Al3+ tolerance in barley could be achieved by combining the best allele of HvAACT1 along with TaALMT1 as a transgene."
FPGA implementation of fractional-order discrete memristor chaotic system and its commensurate and incommensurate synchronisations,A new fourth-order memristor chaotic oscillator is taken to investigate its fractional-order discrete synchronisation. The fractional-order differential model memristor system is transformed to its discrete model and the dynamic properties of the fractional-order discrete system are investigated. A new method for synchronising commensurate and incommensurate fractional discrete chaotic maps are proposed and validated. Numerical results are established to support the proposed methodologies. This method of synchronisation can be applied for any fractional discrete maps. Finally the fractional-order memristor system is implemented in FPGA to show that the chaotic system is hardware realisable.
Thermal engineering of lead-free nanostructured CH3NH3SnCl3 perovskite material for thin-film solar cell,"Perovskite solar cell is a kind of revolutionary investigation in the field of renewable energy which is capable of mitigates the deficiencies of silicon solar cell and its uprising efficiency can bring blessing to society. The presence of lead (Pb) in perovskite solar cell can make worst and negative impact on environment and is not desirable for our society. In this paper, general plans are anticipated by replacement of Pb with tin (Sn) in open atmosphere to fabricate the CH3NH3SnCl3 photovoltaic cells in chlorine (Cl)-rich environment. Excess uses of Cl has positive influences on morphological growth of the film and it also suppresses the oxidation tendency of tin (Sn) with existing oxygen in atmosphere and maintains same chemical atmosphere as bulk. Various characterization tools like X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM) have been used to study the effect of annealing temperature on crystal stricture, phase formation, impurities, and morphologies of the film. Finally, photovoltaic performance was reported using the solar simulator under 1.5 sun illumination."
Comparison of a time- and a speed-based traffic light assistance system,"Traffic light assistance systems (TLASs) can be infrastructure based or on-board, and in the latter case they can inform the driver about the time remaining to green, or about the recommended speed for a smooth passage at green. A speed-based and a time-based on-board system prototype was compared against each other and against a baseline without any assistance system. Using a within-subjects design, 18 participants drove in a fixed-base simulator along a suburban road with signalised intersections, where the delay to green was set to zero (allowing a passage at the current speed), “half-speed” (requiring a clear speed reduction) and “stop” (requiring a substantial speed reduction). Driving behaviour, visual attention distribution and acceptance were evaluated. Both support systems improved driving efficiency and comfort over baseline, with the time-based system achieving higher scores in general. Both systems attracted a substantial amount of visual attention in the current setting; however, single-glance durations were below 1 s, and the number of glances forward were equal in the time-based condition compared to baseline, but lower in the speed-based condition. No red or amber light violations were registered in baseline, while some occurred with any of the systems. Acceptance for both systems was high, with higher scores for the time-based prototype. Overall, an on-board TLAS with a countdown timer to green has the potential to increase efficiency and comfort without strong indications for attention disruption, but the risk for increased red/amber light violations has to be addressed. Improved system design as a way to mitigate potential issues is discussed."
Aggressive somatotrophinomas lacking clinical symptoms: neurosurgical management,"We report our experience about somatotrophinomas without clinical manifestation of acromegaly having radiological- and surgical-verified invasion of the cavernous sinus. We present the clinical, radiological and hormonal status of three patients affected by invasive GH-secreting pituitary adenomas without clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly with elevation of serum IGF-1 from a series of 142 pituitary adenomas operated in our institute with the aid of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Total tumor removal was possible in two of the three cases; the patients show normal hormonal status and no recurrence at long-term follow-up. In the third case, due to the different features of the tumor, complete resection was not possible and a multimodal treatment was performed that allowed regularization of the hormonal status and control of the residual tumor. GH-secreting adenomas without clinical manifestation of acromegaly are uncommon lesions. Total microsurgical excision can be curative. However, in case of partial removal, a tailored adjuvant treatment should be considered to preserve the quality of life of the patient and avoid regrowth of the lesion. In not resectable tumors, preoperative medical treatment with somatostatin analogues is always an option."
Comparative study of the immunological characteristics of three different C57BL/6N mouse substrains,"Inbred mice, a systematically developed homogeneous animal, have been developed to maintain experimental reproducibility and to minimize experimental variables in animal-based studies. In particular, C57BL/6 mice are frequently used in experiments into immunology and antitumor activity experiments. This study was compared the immunological characteristics of C57BL/6NKorl, a Korean developed experimental animal resource, with those of two other C57BL/6N substrains. Mouse body, thymus, and spleen weights in C57BL/6NKorl were not significantly different from those of the other two C57BL/6N substrains. Among the three substrains, there was no difference in the distribution of T and B cells, which are lymphocytes involved in adaptive immunity, and no difference in NK cells related to innate immunity. Results for macrophages and granulocytes, which have roles in innate immunity, were similar in all three substrains. In order to investigate the expressions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and allogenic antigens, splenocytes were separated from obtained spleen and analyzed by using flow cytometry. MHC class I and II molecules, which are important during self/non-self-discrimination, were similar in the three substrains. In addition, expression of alloantigen involved in allografts showed similar results in the three substrain. Thus, the results of this study provide strong evidence that C57BL/6NKorl is immunologically similar to two other C57BL/6N substrains."
Effects of coenzyme Q10 on the antioxidant system in SD rats exposed to lipopolysaccharide-induced toxicity,"The study was performed to see the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on blood biochemical components and hepatic antioxidant system in rats exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced toxicity. A total of 24 rats were allocated to four groups: control (CON), 100 mg/kg BW of LPS (LPS), 100 mg of CoQ10/kg BW with LPS (LCQI) and 300 mg of CoQ10/kg BW with LPS (LCQII). The LPS and LCQI groups showed a significant (P<0.05) increase in the relative spleen weight compared with the CON group without affecting body and liver weights. The blood alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in the LPS group was significantly (P<0.05) greater than that in the CON group, while supplementation with 100 or 300 mg CoQ10 to rats injected with LPS normalized the ALT level in the CON group. In antioxidant systems, the LPS group showed a significantly (P<0.05) higher mRNA and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) than the CON group. The supplementation with CoQ10 to the LPS-treated group normalized the level of SOD, which was comparable to the level of the CON group. Both the mRNA expression and activity of glutathione peroxidase in the LCQI and LCQII groups were higher (P<0.05) than that of the LPS group. However, administration of LPS or CoQ10 unaffected the level of catalase and total antioxidant power. The level of lipid peroxidation in the LCQII group was lower (P<0.05) than that in the LPS group. In conclusion, CoQ10 exerted its favorable effect against liver damage by modulation of antioxidant enzymes in LPS treated rats."
In vivo validation of metastasis-regulating microRNA-766 in human triple-negative breast cancer cells,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the most frequent cancer in women worldwide. Recent improvements in early detection and effective adjuvant chemotherapies have improved the survival of breast cancer patients. Even with initial disease remission, one-third of all breast cancer patients will relapse with distant metastasis. Breast cancer metastasis is largely an incurable disease and the main cause of death among breast cancer patients. Cancer metastasis is comprised of complex processes that are usually not controllable by intervention of a single molecular target. As a single microRNA (miRNA) can affect the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells by concurrently modulating multiple pathway effectors, a metastasis-regulating miRNA would represent a good disease target candidate. In this study, we evaluated the functional capacity of a newly defined human metastasis-related miRNA, miR-766, which was previously identified by comparing a patient-derived xenograft primary tumor model and a metastasis model. Compared to vector-transfected control cells, miR-766-overexpressed triple-negative breast cancer cells exhibited similar primary tumor growth in the orthotopic xenograft model. In contrast, tumor sphere formation and Matrigel invasion were significantly decreased in miR-766-overexpressed breast cancer cells compared with control cancer cells. In addition, lung metastasis was dramatically reduced in miR-766-overexpressed breast cancer cells compared with control cells. Thus, miR-766 affected the distant metastasis process to a greater extent than cancer cell proliferation and primary tumor growth, and may represent a future therapeutic target to effectively control fatal breast cancer metastasis."
Hyperglycemia exacerbates downregulation of dynamin-like protein 1 in ischemic cerebral injury,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability and death. Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of stroke and poor outcomes after brain injury. Dynamin-like protein I (DLP-1) regulates mitochondrial fission and promotes mitochondrial dynamics. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and the downregulation of DLP-1 has been previously identified in a stroke animal model. Here, we investigated the changes in DLP-1 protein expression in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia with induced hyperglycemia. Streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into male rats to induce hyperglycemia, and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was surgically induced 4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment. Brain tissue was isolated 24 hours after MCAO, and cerebral cortex samples were used for this study. Proteomics revealed a decrease in DLP-1 expression in MCAO animals when compared with controls, and this downregulation was more prominent in MCAO animals with hyperglycemia. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses confirmed that DLP-1 was significantly downregulated in MCAO-injured animals with hyperglycemia compared to those without hyperglycemia. The decrease in DLP-1 indicates mitochondrial morphological changes and dysfunction. Together, these results suggest that the severe decrease of DLP-1 seen after brain injury under hyperglycemic conditions may exacerbate the damage to the brain."
Preclinical safety assessment of Angelica acutiloba using a 13-week repeated dose oral toxicity study in rats,"Angelica acutiloba (AA), a Japanese species of Danggui, has been used worldwide as a traditional herbal medicine with several bioactivities including anti-diabetic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-obesity. However, there is lack of toxicological data available to evaluate potential long-term toxicity and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of AA extract in accordance with the test guidelines published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the 14-day repeat-dose toxicity study, no adverse effects on mortality, body weight change, clinical signs, and organ weights was found following repeat oral administration to rats for 14 days (125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight), leading that 2000 mg/kg is the highest recommended dose of AA extract for the 13-week repeat-dose oral toxicity study. In the 13-week repeat-dose oral toxicity study, the AA extract was orally administered to groups of rats for 13 weeks (125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight) to compare between control and AA extract groups. The administration of AA extract did not produce mortality or remarkable clinical signs during this 13-week study. And, the data revealed that there were no significant differences in food/water consumption, body weight, hematological parameters, clinical chemistry parameters, gross macroscopic findings, organ weight and histopathology in comparison to the control group. On the basis of these results, the subchronic NOAEL of the AA extract was more than 2000 mg/kg/day when tested in rats. And, the AA extract is considered safe to use orally as a traditional herbal medicine."
Lipolytic effect of novel extracts from mulberry (Morus alba) leaves fermented with Cordyceps militaris in the primary adipocytes derived from SD rats,"Mulberry (Morus alba) leaves are known to have therapeutic effects on lipid metabolism including lipogenesis, lipolysis and hyperlipidemia. However, novel compounds with strong lipolytic ability among 27 extracts of the mulberry leaves fermented with Cordyceps militaris (EMfCs) have not yet been identified. Therefore, the cAMP concentration and cell viability were measured in the primary adipocytes of SD (Sprague Dawley) rats and 3T3-L1 cells after treatment of 27 EMfCs. Briefly, mulberry leaves powders amended with three different concentrations (0, 25 and 50%) of silkworm pupae (SWP) powder were fermented with 10% C. militaris (v/w) during three different periods (3, 4 and 6 weeks). A total of 27 extracts were obtained from the fermented mulberry leaves powders using three different solvents (dH2O, 50% EtOH and 95% EtOH). Among the 27 EMfCs treated groups, a significant increase in the concentration of cAMP was detected in primary adipocytes treated with 10 extracts when compared with the Vehicle treated group. However, their cAMP concentration did not agree completely with the non-toxicity, although most extracts showed non-toxicity. Furthermore, the concentration of cAMP and level of free glycerol gradually increased in a dose dependent manner (100, 200 and 400μg/mL) of 4M3-95 contained cordycepin without any significant toxicity. Overall, the results of this study provide strong evidence that 4M3-95 extract derived from EMfCs can stimulate the lipolysis of primary adipocytes at an appropriate concentration and therefore have the potential for use as lipolytic agents to treat obesity."
The influence of electrode tip radius on dynamic resistance in spot welding,"Electrode wear has a major impact on the quality of the spot welding joint. It is important to evaluate the electrode tip condition based on a simple method. In this paper, the dynamic resistance is analyzed, and the relationship between the dynamic resistance and the radius of electrode tip is investigated. It is difficult to obtain the relationship between the electrode tip radius and real-time dynamic resistance. The dynamic resistance is represented by the sum of the squares of the real-time resistances in every half cycle. It is virtually impossible to research the electrode tip radius based on only one dynamic resistance of spot welding joint. The average value of dozens of dynamic resistances should be analyzed, and the means of 20 dynamic resistances are analyzed in this study. The average value of dynamic resistances from the first to seventh cycle during the nugget-growth stage has a strong corresponding relation to the electrode tip radius, which can be used to evaluate the electrode wear."
Potential of Bacillus sp. LG7 as a Promising Source of Ligninolytic Enzymes for Industrial and Biotechnological Applications,"Ligninolytic bacteria are considered a major source of ligninolytic enzymes, which are widely used in a variety of industrial and biotechnological processes. The present study aimed to isolate ligninolytic bacteria with the ability to simultaneously produce laccase, lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) with high enzyme activity. Ligninolytic indicator dyes were used for liquid- and solid-phase assays to screen for ligninolytic bacteria. One bacterial strain with the most outstanding results was chosen for further investigation. This isolate was identified as Bacillus sp. LG7 using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Solid-state fermentation was carried out using wheat straw to test the ability of Bacillus sp. LG7 to produce ligninolytic enzymes. The activities of laccase, LiP and MnP were determined using standard enzymatic assays. Bacillus sp. LG7 showed the highest laccase activity on the 6th day of incubation (274.03 ± 2.45 U/L). The highest LiP enzyme activity was also found on the 6th day of incubation (265.48 ± 1.24 U/L). Meanwhile, for MnP, the highest enzyme activity was obtained on the 4th day of incubation (2235.57 ± 2.02 U/L). This study presents Bacillus sp. LG7 as a promising source of ligninolytic enzymes to be used in a variety of industrial and biotechnological processes."
BMI-1 Promotes Self-Renewal of Radio- and Temozolomide (TMZ)-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells,"Breast cancer is a hormone-dependent malignancy and is the most prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality among females. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are common treatments of breast cancer. However, tumor relapse and metastasis following therapy are major clinical challenges. The importance of B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI-1) was implicated in cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and tumor initiation. We established radio- and temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant (IRC-R) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in therapeutic resistance. Cell proliferation and sphere number were dramatically elevated, and BMI-1 was remarkably upregulated, in IRC-R cells compared to parental cells. Silencing BMI-1 by RNA interference only affected the cell proliferation of IRC-R but not parental cells, suggesting the critical role of BMI-1 in radio- and TMZ resistance. We used a xenograft mice model to elucidate that BMI-1 was necessary in tumor development by assessing tumor volume and Ki67 expression. We found that Hedgehog (Hhg) signaling exerted synergized functions together with BMI-1, implicating the importance of BMI-1 in Hhg signaling. Downregulation of BMI-1 could be an effective strategy to suppress tumor growth, which supports the potential clinical use of targeting BMI-1 in breast cancer treatment."
Extranuclear Translocation of High-Mobility Group A1 Reduces the Invasion of Extravillous Trophoblasts Involved in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia: New Aspect of High-Mobility Group A1,"Objective: High-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) protein is known to express in trophoblast; however, the role of migration has not been reported to date. In this study, we investigated the role of HMGA1 on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia using immortalized human trophoblast cell (HTR-8/SVneo). Materials and Methods: We investigated HMGA1 expression in cytotrophoblasts derived from our preeclampsia model mouse, the CD40L mouse, using immunofluorescence. Wound healing and transwell migration assays were also performed using HTR-8/SVneo (extravillous trophoblast) cells transfected with DNA or siRNA of HMGA1. The effect of extranuclear translocation of HMGA1 on the migration of extravillous trophoblastic cells was evaluated using deoxycholic acid (DCA). Results: HMGA1 was expressed exclusively in the nuclei of trophoblasts derived from control mice; cytoplasmic expression was observed only in CD40L mice with preeclampsia. Furthermore, overexpression of HMGA1 in the nuclei of HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated cell proliferation and migration. Translocation of nuclear HMGA1 to cytoplasm treated with DCA reduced cell migration. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings demonstrate that proper subcellular localization of HMGA1 is important for its function in trophoblast cells, and suggest that aberrant cytoplasmic expression of HMGA1 contributes to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through impairment of trophoblast migration."
Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis and Endometrial Adenocarcinoma Express High Levels of Myostatin and Its Receptors Messenger RNAs,"Myostatin is a growth factor member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, which is known to play major roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. The present study investigated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of myostatin and myostatin receptors (activin receptor-like kinase 4 [ALK4], transforming growth factor (TGF)-β type I receptor kinase [ALK5] and activin receptor type IIB [ActRIIB]) in endometrium of healthy women during menstrual cycle as well as in benign (endometriosis, polyps) and malignant (endometrial adenocarcinoma) conditions. Endometrial specimens were collected by hysteroscopy, whereas endometriotic lesions were collected by laparoscopy, and adenocarcinomas were sampled after hysterectomy. Total RNA was extracted from tissue homogenates, and gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Myostatin and myostatin receptors mRNAs were expressed by healthy endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle, with no differences between the proliferative and secretory phase. The highest myostatin mRNA expression was found in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) and in endometrial carcinoma; expression was also found in ovarian endometrioma (OMA ) and endometrial polyps. Myostatin receptors mRNA expression was higher in DIE and adenocarcinomas compared to control endometrium. The expression of ALK5 and ActRIIB in OMA was higher than in controls, whereas polyps had an increased expression of ALK5 mRNA. In conclusion, the present data showed for the first time the expression of myostatin in healthy endometrium and a higher expression in endometriosis and endometrial cancer, suggesting myostatin involvement in human endometrial physiology and related pathologies."
Status and prospects of light bino–higgsino dark matter in natural SUSY,"Given the recent progress in dark matter direction detection experiments, we examine a light bino–higgsino dark matter (DM) scenario (\(M_1<100\) GeV and \(\mu <300\) GeV) in natural supersymmetry with the electroweak fine tuning measure \(\Delta _\mathrm{EW}<30\). By imposing various constraints, we note that: (i) For \(\mathrm{sign}(\mu /M_1)=+1\), the parameter space allowed by the DM relic density and collider bounds can almost be excluded by the very recent spin-independent (SI) scattering cross-section limits from the XENON1T (2017) experiment. (ii) For \(\mathrm{sign}(\mu /M_1)=-1\), the SI limits can be evaded due to the cancelation effects in the \(h\tilde{\chi }^0_1\tilde{\chi }^0_1\) coupling, while rather stringent constraints come from the PandaX-II (2016) spin-dependent (SD) scattering cross-section limits, which can exclude the higgsino mass \(|\mu |\) and the LSP mass \(m_{\tilde{\chi }^0_1}\) up to about 230 and 37 GeV, respectively. Furthermore, the surviving parameter space will be fully covered by the projected XENON1T experiment or the future trilepton searches at the HL-LHC."
The Changes of Cytoskeletal Proteins Induced by the Fast Effect of Estrogen in Mouse Blastocysts and Its Roles in Implantation,"It is necessary for estrogen to activate mouse blastocysts, so that they can attach to endometrial epithelium in implantation and in our previous research, we have proved estrogen can induce a fast increase in intracellular calcium of mouse blastocysts through acting on G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), which further promotes their implantation. Moreover, there has been evidence that cytoskeletal proteins are involved in integrin-mediated adhesion of many kinds of cells, which also plays an important role in implantation. To prove estrogen induces rapidly the changes of cytoskeletal proteins in mouse blastocysts and its roles in implantation, we first used immunofluorescence staining and laser confocal microscopy to investigate the fast effect of estrogen on the expression and localization of cytoskeletal proteins in mouse blastocysts. Second, we used electroporation associated with RNA interference to knock down one of the important cytoskeletal proteins, talin, in the mouse blastocyst cells to investigate the fast effect of estrogen on the localization of integrins and the binding activity of integrins with their ligand fibronectin (FN). At last, mouse blastocysts with different treatments were cultured with FN or uterine epithelial cell line Ishikawa in vitro, respectively, and transferred into the bilateral uterine horns of recipient mice, to study the role of the fast effect of estrogen on cytoskeletal proteins in blastocysts adhesion and implantation. Our results indicated that estradiol (E2), E2 conjugated with bovine serum album (E2-BSA) and G-1 (a GPR30-specific agonist) could induce cytoskeletal protein talin, vinculin, and actin to cluster in the mouse blastocysts, while G15 (a GPR30-specific antagonist) and BAPTA (a calcium chelator) may block this effect induced by E2-BSA. Furthermore, E2-BSA could induce the clustering and relocalization of integrin β1 and β3 and increase the FN-binding activity of integrins in blastocyst cells, while E2-BSA could not induce these effects in the blastocysts pretreated with talin-small interfering RNA (siRNA). Meanwhile, the adhesion rate and implantation rate of blastocysts pretreated with talin-siRNA were significantly lower than those pretreated with control-siRNA. We provided the first evidence that the fast effect of estrogen might cause the clustering of the cytoskeletal proteins in mouse blastocyst cells and further induce the changes of localization and functional activity of integrins in the blastocyst cells, which play important roles in blastocyst implantation."
Conventional and transgenic strategies to enhance the acid soil tolerance of barley,"The aluminum (Al3+) tolerance of barley cultivars predominately from Brazil was compared to that of cultivars from other countries, wild barley accessions, and a transgenic line (L5) over-expressing TaALMT1, the major Al3+ tolerance gene from wheat. After screening conventional germplasm for Al3+ tolerance in hydroponics, 18 genotypes were further characterized in a short-term soil experiment. Among the Brazilian cultivars, Antarctica 01 and BRS Mariana showed the greatest relative root length (RRL) in acid soil. However, these cultivars were significantly less tolerant than the foreign cultivars Dayton (USA) and Murasakimochi (Japan) and the transgenic line L5 which out-performed all conventional genotypes. In long-term growth trials, the transgenic line produced the greatest relative root and relative shoot dry weight. Relative grain yield was greatest in the transgenic line and Dayton. All genotypes were also scored for two genetic markers linked to HvAACT1, the major Al3+ tolerance gene in barley. One marker detects a 1-kb insertion in the promoter that increases gene expression and leads to increased Al3+-activated citrate efflux from root apices. The other marker detects a 21-bp indel downstream of the coding region. The 1-kb insertion was only detected in Dayton and Murasakimochi that were the best performing cultivars among the non-transgenic germplasm. Interestingly, the Brazilian cultivars with an intermediate level of tolerance, Antarctica 01 and BRS Mariana, lacked the 1-kb insertion but had enhanced HvAACT1 expression compared to an Al3+-sensitive cultivar. No clear correlation was observed between Al3+ tolerance and the 21-bp indel marker in the short-term soil trials. We conclude that improved Al3+ tolerance in barley could be achieved by combining the best allele of HvAACT1 along with TaALMT1 as a transgene."
FPGA implementation of fractional-order discrete memristor chaotic system and its commensurate and incommensurate synchronisations,A new fourth-order memristor chaotic oscillator is taken to investigate its fractional-order discrete synchronisation. The fractional-order differential model memristor system is transformed to its discrete model and the dynamic properties of the fractional-order discrete system are investigated. A new method for synchronising commensurate and incommensurate fractional discrete chaotic maps are proposed and validated. Numerical results are established to support the proposed methodologies. This method of synchronisation can be applied for any fractional discrete maps. Finally the fractional-order memristor system is implemented in FPGA to show that the chaotic system is hardware realisable.
The Immunogenicity and Immunoprotection of VBP3 Multi-epitope Vaccine Targeting Angiogenesis and Tumor Inhibition in Lung Cancer-Bearing Mice,"The proangiogenic factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which work synergistically are essential for tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. The bFGF/VEGF multi-epitope complex peptide (VBP3) was constructed with six different epitope peptides from human bFGF and VEGF. The VBP3 multi-epitope complex peptide was demonstrated good immunogenicity to elicit high titer anti-bFGF antibody and anti-VEGF antibody in C57BL/6 mice. In Lewis lung cancer (LLC) mouse model, the tumor growth was significantly inhibited which resulted in a longer survival time. The immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor angiogenesis was inhibited with VBP3 vaccine vaccination. The results of flow cytometry (FCM) assay showed that the activation of dentritic cells (DC), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were stimulated while the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages were suppressed in tumor microenvironment. The polyclonal antibodies were separated from the VBP3-vaccinated mice. The CCK-8 assay results showed that the proliferation of LL-2 cancer cells was inhibited and the Western-blot assay results showed that the phosphorylation levels of Akt and Erk1/2 were decreased by the antibodies. The results indicated that the VBP3 could stimulate specific immune responses to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. The VBP3 with good immunogenicity and immunoprotection could be used as a potential therapeutic peptide vaccine for tumor therapy."

"Theoretical approach to the molecular structure, chemical reactivity, molecular orbital analysis, spectroscopic properties (IR, UV, NMR), and NBO analysis of deferiprone","In this investigation, the structural, electronic properties, 13C and 1H NMR parameters and the first hyperpolarizability of deferiprone are computed in the gas phase and various solvents at the M062X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The solvent effect on the structural parameters, frontier orbital energies, 13C and 1H NMR parameters is also explored based on a polarizable continuum model. These consequences specify that the polarity of solvents affects the structures and spectroscopic properties of deferiprone. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are evaluated by employing the gauge-invariant atomic orbital method. NBO analysis is exploited to examine the hybridization of atoms, atomic charges, and their second order stabilization energy within the molecule."
QSAR study by the RASMS method of DABO derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors,The random sampling analysis on molecular surface (RASMS) method is applied to study quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) modeled by multiple linear regression for dihydroalkoxybenzyloxopyrimidines (DABO) derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors. The correlation coefficients (R2cum) and cross-validation correlation coefficients (Q2CV) obtained by the models are 0.852 and 0.755 for 74 DABO derivatives. Satisfactory results show that information about the biological activity can be systemically expressed by the RASMS method that can be a useful structural expression methodology for the study of QSAR of the DABO derivatives.
Structure of a Na+ cation hydration shell on heating in a planar nanopore,Resistance to heating above the boiling point of water of the molecular structure of a single-charged sodium cation hydration shell growing under the conditions of a model planar nanopore with a width of 5 Å is studied by computer simulation. Monte Carlo calculations of spatial correlation functions are performed in a detailed model with regard to many-body interactions between the ion and water molecules. The system demonstrates an increased resistance to thermal fluctuations along the pore plane and a decreased one in the transverse direction. The heating is accompanied by an enhanced coating effect of molecules around the ion and a diminished effect of extruding the ion out of its own hydration shell. The orientational molecular order due to strong spatial anisotropy inside the nanopore is much more stable than the hydrogen bonds between the molecules.
In situ analysis of the formation steps of gold nanoparticles by oleylamine reduction,"A colloidal solution of gold nanoparticles is synthesized with the use of sodium tetrachloroaurate(III) as a precursor, oleylamine as a reducer and surfactant, and 1-octadecene as a solvent. Reaction stages are analyzed in situ by optical (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy with a simultaneous analysis of particle sizes by dynamic light scattering and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy for the analysis of the gold oxidation state. After the synthesis the size of obtained nanoparticles is determined by transmission electron microscopy. The analysis of the obtained experimental data reveals the presence of three main steps in the reduction reaction mechanism, corresponding to Au3+, Au+, Au0, which enables the construction of the reaction model. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of gold(I) complexes with oleylamine, followed by polymerization and the formation of gold nanoclusters coated with oleylamine."
Crystal structure of copper(II) fluoroindate(III) Cu(InF4)2·10H2O,"A new indium(III) fluoride complex Cu(InF4)2·10H2O with the divalent Cu2+ cation is synthesized for first time, and its crystal structure, which is a new type of the structure of complex fluorides of trivalent metals with divalent cations, obtained from a hydrofluoric acid solution, is studied. The structure of Cu(InF4)2·10H2O is monoclinic, space group P21/a. The structure is formed by isolated centrosymmetric distorted octahedral complex [Cu(H2O)6]2+ cations and isolated distorted octahedral complex [InF4(H2O)2]– anions with the cis arrangement of coordinated water molecules. The branched system of O–H·F hydrogen bonds, which is formed by the coordinated H2O molecules with the F atoms of anions, combines the structural elements of the compound to form a three-dimensional framework."
"A novel dinuclear CuII complex based on flexible bis(triazole): Synthesis, structure and physical properties","New dinuclear copper(II) complex [Cu2(BTE)2(N3)4] (1) (BTE = 1,1′-(2,2′-oxybis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(1H-1,2,4-triazole)) is synthesized and characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that complex 1 is a centrosymmetric dinuclear Cu(II) cluster unit with a Cu–Cu separation of 3.267(6) Å. In addition, complex 1 exhibits a high photocatalytic degradation activity for the degradation of rhodamine B."
Crystal and molecular structure of methyl-(4-chlorophenyl)sulfone,Sulfones are known to be biologically active compounds. X-ray diffraction is used to determine the crystal and molecular structure of methyl-(4-chlorophenyl)sulfone. The closest molecules are in pairs oriented to each other by their chlorine atoms. The crystal architecture is formed by endless ribbons of paired associates of the molecules under study.
"Unexpected C=N bond cleavage in H3salmp: Synthesis and structures of [LnNa(salmp)(sal)]2·6EtOH (Ln = Sm, Er; H3salmp = 2-bis(salicylidieneamino) methylphenol; sal = salicylaldehydato)","The reaction of LnCl3 with Na3salmp/H3salmp (H3salmp = 2-bis(salicylidieneamino)methyl-phenol) affords [LnNa(salmp)(sal)]2 (Ln = Sm(I), Er(II); sal = salicylaldehydato) complexes being different from the known Ln-salmp complex of [Sm(salmp)(THF)]2. In the reaction, the cleavage of C=N bonds happens in H3salmp, and the regenerated salicylaldehydato anion arises and takes part in the coordination. Both complexes are characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography."
"Experimental and theoretical studies of diethyl 2-(ter-butylimino)-2,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate using DFT calculations","In this study, diethyl 2-(ter-butylimino)-2,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate compound 1 is synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The DFT calculations are carried out for compound 1 by B3LYP and PBE1PBE methods. The bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles, charge density on the atoms of 1 are calculated. A comparison of the DFT calculations indicate that the B3LYP method with the 6-311G++(d,p) basis set can give accurate results. The 13C NMR and 1H NMR chemical shifts of 1 are calculated and compared with the available experimental data on the molecules. The nuclear independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations are utilized for the pyrrole ring in compound 1."

Temperature effect on the structure and characteristics of ZnS-based quantum dots,"The synthesis of zinc sulfide (ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) by microwave heating in a water-ethanol medium is proposed. The effect of the synthesis temperature (80 °C, 100 °C, 120 °C, and 150 °C) on the QD characteristics is examined. Based on the analysis of X-ray diffraction profiles the conclusion is drawn that the hexagonal ZnS phase of wurtzite type with an average nanocrystal size of 2.6-3.7 nm forms in the synthesized QDs. The nanocrystallite size is found to increase with the QD synthesis heating temperature. The analysis of X-ray absorption spectra (XANES) at the zinc K-edge indicates a higher crystallinity of the QD samples prepared at higher synthesis temperatures. The combined analysis of X-ray diffraction profiles, optical diffuse reflectance spectra, and X-ray absorption spectra implies the following possible QD structure: the pure hexagonal ZnS phase of wurtzite type in the bulk of nanoparticles and the amorphous ZnO phase in the surface layer of nanoparticles."
Exotic ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional quantum material C3N,"The search for and study of exotic quantum states in novel low-dimensional quantum materials have triggered extensive research in recent years. Here, we systematically study the electronic and magnetic structures in the newly discovered two-dimensional quantum material C3N within the framework of density functional theory. The calculations demonstrate that C3N is an indirect-band semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.38 eV, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. Interestingly, we find van Hove singularities located at energies near the Fermi level, which is half that of graphene. Thus, the Fermi energy easily approaches that of the singularities, driving the system to ferromagnetism, under charge carrier injection, such as electric field gating or hydrogen doping. These findings not only demonstrate that the emergence of magnetism stems from the itinerant electron mechanism rather than the effects of local magnetic impurities, but also open a new avenue to designing field-effect transistor devices for possible realization of an insulator–ferromagnet transition by tuning an external electric field."
Analytical assessment of some characteristic ratios for s-wave superconductors,"We evaluate some thermodynamic quantities and characteristic ratios that describe low- and high-temperature s-wave superconducting systems. Based on a set of fundamental equations derived within the conformal transformation method, a simple model is proposed and studied analytically. After including a one-parameter class of fluctuations in the density of states, the mathematical structure of the s-wave superconducting gap, the free energy difference, and the specific heat difference is found and discussed in an analytic manner. Both the zero-temperature limit T = 0 and the subcritical temperature range T ≲ Tc are discussed using the method of successive approximations. The equation for the ratio R1, relating the zero-temperature energy gap and the critical temperature, is formulated and solved numerically for various values of the model parameter. Other thermodynamic quantities are analyzed, including a characteristic ratio R2, quantifying the dynamics of the specific heat jump at the critical temperature. It is shown that the obtained model results coincide with experimental data for low-Tc superconductors. The prospect of application of the presented model in studies of high-Tc superconductors and other superconducting systems of the new generation is also discussed."
Mining the global diversity of barley for Fusarium resistance using leaf and spike inoculations,"Fusarium graminearum is a devastating fungal pathogen that causes significant yield and quality losses in cereals. We utilized a diversity set of barley (140 genotypes) to explore vital resistance alleles against this aggressive pathogen. The resistance assessment was carried out on spikes and leaves via artificial inoculations under control conditions. The phenotypic data was subjected to genome-wide association analysis using a genetic map based on DArT and SNP markers. This analysis revealed eleven and nine marker trait associations for leaf disease scoring (LDS) and spike disease scoring (SDS), respectively. The strongest QTL for LDS was found on chromosome 1H where a minor allele of wild origin decreased disease symptoms by 78%. The major QTL allele for SDS was linked with marker locus SCRI_RS174710 on chromosome 5H. In addition, four favorable epistatic interactions effects were found in decreasing disease symptoms. Overall, three QTL were common for LDS and SDS, which indicates a partial genetic relatedness of these resistances in barley. The QTL alleles for LDS and SDS will help to establish organ specific resistances in cultivated barley."
Abelian coverings of the projective plane by Enriques surfaces,"We study abelian coverings of the projective plane by Enriques surfaces. We show that if the quotient space of an Enriques surface by a finite abelian group G is isomorphic to the projective plane, then the action of G on an Enriques surface is semi-symplectic, and G is isomorphic to \({\mathbb {Z}}/2{\mathbb {Z}}^{\oplus l}\) where \(l=2,3\), or 4. Further, we give examples to \(l=2,3,4\)."
"Characterization and ranking of subtropical trees in a rural plantation forest of Uttar Pradesh, India, as fuel wood using fuel wood value index (FVI)","The present study investigate fuel wood characteristics on the basis of fuel wood value index (FVI), a proximate and ultimate analysis of 12 subtropical tree species of rural areas of Uttar Pradesh in northern India, to sort out the tree species commonly used by the rural communities and examine their energy properties. The FVI was determined on the basis of calorific value (CV), bulk density (BD), and ash content (AC). The highest CV (22.56 MJ/kg) and BD (0.80 g/cm3) were found in Prosopis juliflora, and the lowest CV (17.32 MJ/kg) and BD (0.32 g/cm3) were found in Streblus asper. The AC was found maximum in Pithecellobium dulce (2.81%) and minimum in S. asper (0.83%). Moisture content was ranged between 38.70 and 58.67%. Investigation of elemental composition in fuel wood revealed that carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen (CHN), and sulfur value ranged from 40 to 46% C, 4.80 to 6.80% H, 0.03 to 1.40% N, and sulfur was defected only in some species and its maximum value (0.012) was found in species of Tectona grandis, T. arjuna, and Ficus benghalensis. This study revealed that only the single basic parameter is not sufficient for identifying the suitable tree species for fuel wood. On the basis of FVI and other fuel wood properties species, P. juliflora, T. grandis, F. benghalensis, Alstonia scholaris, and Holopetelea integrifolia are the most preferred fuel wood species among the 12 trees studied. To enable choice of plant species for future energy plantation program may help the local people to take maximum benefit to be used as bioenergy if electricity and alternative energy sources are not available in such remote areas."
"Kinematics, Singularity Study and Optimization of an Innovative Spherical Parallel Manipulator with Large Workspace","A novel design for three degree of freedom (DoF) mechanical arm, i.e. a 3-PUS/S Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) with three rotational motions is proposed in this article. In addition, its kinematic equations, singularity and design optimization are studied according to its application. The proposed parallel robot that has three legs with three prismatic joints can rotate about Z-axis unlimitedly. Therefore, the manipulator has large workspace and good flexibility, hence being attractive to study. To complete the kinematic analysis of the manipulator, three stages are considered as follows. At the first, the kinematics of the SPM is explained to obtain the positions, velocities, and accelerations. Furthermore, the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of the 3-PUS/S Parallel Manipulator are derived. The results are verified by the use of CAD and Adams software. Next, the Jacobian matrix obtained from the kinematic equations is utilized to study the different types of singularities. Finally, the optimum dimensions of the manipulator based on kinematic and singularity features are studied by Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the Global Condition Index (GCI) is maximized. The results help the designers to achieve an ideal geometry for the parallel manipulator with good workspace and minimum singularity."
A Nomogram Based on Clinical Factors to Predict the Serum Myoglobin Levels Following Bariatric Surgery,"Increased serum myoglobin levels following bariatric surgery can predict rhabdomyolysis, a severe postoperative complication, which can induce acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical factors to predict increased postoperative serum myoglobin levels following bariatric surgery."
RF characteristics of flexible circuits patterned with hybrid Ag paste,"Printed electronics based on nanomaterials has been a potential alternative to conventional electronic technology and is favorable for flexible polymer substrates. However, a printed circuit has insufficient electrical performance and mechanical reliability under flexible stress. We designed hybrid Ag pastes containing Ag nanoparticles (NPs, 30–50 nm) and Ag flake (F, 2.5–3.5 μm in diameter) particles to overcome the obstacles of printed electronics. Six types of Ag paste (Ag NPs-x wt% F paste, x = 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100) were screen-printed onto a polyimide substrate and sintered at 200 °C for fabricating a flexible circuit. We simulated a coplanar waveguide pattern before measuring the S-parameter using high frequency structural simulation. To investigate the radio frequency characteristics of various Ag circuits under sliding stress, a network analyzer and Cascade’s probe system in the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz were employed before and after 100,000 sliding cycles. Hybrid Ag circuits showed stable electrical conductance and signal transmission, while pure Ag particle circuits showed a definite drop of electrical conductance (over 30% increase of electrical resistance) under cyclic sliding stress. The microstructural crack behavior demonstrated that the Ag F content within the Ag hybrid circuits effectively suppressed crack propagation, leading to improved flexibility of the sintered Ag circuit."
Microwave dielectric properties of high Q and temperature stable Li3(Mg1−xNix)2NbO6 ceramics,"In this paper, the Li3(Mg1−xNix)2NbO6 (0.02 ≦ x ≦ 0.08) ceramics are prepared by a solid state reaction method. The effects of Ni2+ substitution on the microwave dielectric properties, microstructure and sintering properties are investigated systematically. The XRD patterns reveal that all the samples could form solid solution with a single Li3Mg2NbO6 phase in the sintering process. The variation in Q × f values is similar to that in bulk density, and tremendous improvement of Q × f values could be attributed to bigger grains and high densification. Since the more polarizable Mg2+ ion is replaced by the less polarizable Ni2+ ion, the permittivities decrease almost linearly with increasing Ni2+ content. Otherwise, with the x value increase from 0.02 to 0.08, the τ
f
 values could be effectively adjusted to near zero, but the decreasing porosity-corrected permittivities would damage the stability of crystal structure, which make the τ
f
 values shift toward the negative direction. In general, the Li3(Mg0.96Ni0.04)2NbO6 ceramics sintered at 1175 °C for 6 h exhibit superior microwave dielectric properties of εr ~ 15.22, Q × f ~ 126,784 GHz, τ
f
 ~ − 2.63 ppm/°C, which demonstrate that the ceramics could be selected as a promising low loss and temperature stable material for future application."
Carboxybetaine-modified succinylated chitosan-based beads encourage pancreatic β-cells (Min-6) to form islet-like spheroids under in vitro conditions,"In vitro, pancreatic β-cells tend to reduce their ability to aggregate into islets and lose insulin-producing ability, likely due to insufficient cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions that are essential for β-cell retention, viability and functionality. In response to these needs, surfaces of succinylated chitosan-based beads (NSC) were modified with zwitterionic carboxy-betaine (CB) moieties, a compatible osmolyte known to regulate cellular hydration state, and used to promote the formation of β-cell spheroids using a conventional 2D cell culture technique. The NSC were synthesised by ionic gelation and surface-functionalised with CB using carbodiimide chemistry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed as characterisation tools to confirm the successful modification of the succinylated chitosan material into spherical beads with rough surfaces and a diameter of 0.4 µm. NSC with and without CB were re-suspended at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/mL in saline medium and tested in vitro with MIN6 murine pancreatic β-cell line. Results showed that a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL, NSC-CB encouraged pancreatic MIN6 cells to proliferate and form spheroids via E-cadherin and Pdx-1 activation within 48 h in culture. These spheroids, with a size of approximately 80 µm, exhibited high cell viability and enhanced insulin protein expression and secretion when compared to cells organised by the non-modified beads."
Intensified blood glucose treatment in diabetic patients undergoing a liver transplant: impact on graft evolution at 3 months and at 5 years,The debate about the impact of intensified hyperglycemia treatment is still ranging. The main objective was to assess whether intensive glycemic control in hospitalized diabetic patients undergoing a liver transplant is associated with a lower rate of graft rejection at 3 months and at 5 years post-transplant.
Heat recovery of dedusting systems in electric arc furnaces: concept of a bottoming cogeneration plant and techno-economic analysis,"Steelworks require large amount of energy in reduction, fusion and refining processes. A mini-mill is a steelwork that produces steel by melting scrap metal, pig iron and metallic elements in electric arc furnaces. Depending on the desired product, the refining process requires vacuum degassing to remove contaminant gases from the liquid steel. The vacuum in the degassing process can be obtained through steam ejectors, which use superheated steam. Furthermore, environmental legislation requires mini-mills to have dedusting systems over the electric furnaces. In general, a dedusting system generates high flow rates of hot off-gases, which indicates an interesting potential for heat recovering. In this paper, a cogeneration plant to recover heat from the dedusting system of a Brazilian mini-mill is proposed. The actual operation data are considered to calculate the heat available and to conceptualize a bottoming cogeneration plant that generates electric power and superheated steam for the ejectors of the degassing process. Results show that the proposed plant can generate 45.4% of the steam required by the ejectors and up to 2.4% of the power required by the electric arc furnace. Also, the heat recovering from the dedusting system reduces the use of cooling water by 29.3%. From an economic viewpoint, the cogeneration plant decreased the expenses for power, steam and cooling water by 1.5, 32 and 29%, respectively. Overall, there was an expense reduction of 4.8%, resulting in a payback period of 4.1 years in the case base. For a projected best case scenario, the payback period is about 2.3 years."
Evidence of G-protein-coupled receptor and substrate transporter heteromerization at a single molecule level,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can constitute complexes with non-GPCR integral membrane proteins, while such interaction has not been demonstrated at a single molecule level so far. We here investigated the potential interaction between the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). Both the proteins are expressed endogenously on the basolateral plasma membrane of the thyrocytes and are involved in stimulation of thyroid hormone production and release. Indeed, we demonstrate strong interaction between both the proteins which causes a suppressed activation of Gq/11 by TSH-stimulated TSHR. Thus, we provide not only evidence for a novel interaction between the TSHR and MCT8, but could also prove this interaction on a single molecule level. Moreover, this interaction forces biased signaling at the TSHR. These results are of general interest for both the GPCR and the MFS research fields."
"Tight co-twin similarity of monozygotic twins for hTERT protein level of T cell subsets, for telomere length and mitochondrial DNA copy number, but not for telomerase activity","Our study analyzed lymphocyte subpopulations of 32 monozygotic twins and compared the level of the catalytic reverse transcriptase protein subunit (hTERT) in T lymphocytes (Tly), helper- (Th), cytotoxic- (Tc) and regulatory T cell (Treg) subgroups. Four variables related to telomere and mitochondrial biology were simultaneously assessed, applying multi-parametric flow cytometry, TRAP-ELISA assay and qPCR standard curve method on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of genetically matched individuals. Twin data of telomerase activity (TA), hTERT protein level, telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) were analyzed for co-twin similarity. The present study has provided novel information by demonstrating very high intraclass correlation (ICC) of hTERT protein level in T lymphocytes (0.891) and in both Th (0.896), Treg (0.885) and Tc (0.798) cell subgroups. When comparing results measured from PBMCs, intraclass correlation was also high for telomere length (0.815) and considerable for mtDNA copy number (0.524), and again exceptionally high for the rate-limiting telomerase subunit, hTERT protein level (0.946). In contrast, telomerase activity showed no co-twin similarity (ICC 0). By comparing relative amounts of hTERT protein levels in different lymphocyte subgroups of twin subjects, in Treg cells significantly higher level could be detected compared to Tly, Th or Tc cell subgroups. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed co-twin similarity in MZ twins for the above four variables and alongside assessed their relationship, whereby positive association was found between TL and mtDNAcn."
Teaching Turkish as a Foreign Language with Interactive Whiteboards: A Case Study of Multilingual Learners,"This study attempts to explore the effects of interactive whiteboard (IWB) technology use on students’ achievement and perceptions in Turkish as a foreign language instructional context. The participants included 19 Nigerian Turkish Language learners who were all fluent in three languages: English, Hausa, and their tribal languages. They had been learning Turkish for the last four months when they began the study using an IWB in their Turkish writing classes. For the 14-week study, participants were exposed to the IWB instruction for six hours per week. Overall implementation took place in a Turkish Language Learning Research Center in a state university in Turkey. We have collected the data via the Interactive Whiteboard Survey for University Students, achievement tests as well as semi-structured interviews with students to support quantitative data after the implementation T-tests and descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of the survey and content analysis for the interview data by using, QSR Nvivo 8.0, a qualitative data analysis tool. Results revealed that participants developed positive attitudes towards the IWB use and were satisfied with the contributions of IWB use in their language classes such as writing and grammar."
Detection of illicit material using neutron activation: weakness and solutions,Poisoning the illicit materials by a neutron absorber leads to false detection when the detection is relied on combined thermal neutron activation and fast neutron activation to identify the elements of interest. The use of adjacent transmission thermal neutron detector for verifying the presence of neutron poisons and to trigger an alarm was investigated experimentally and using MCNP calculations. The illicit material of high hydrogen content will affect the detector response in the presence or absence of poisons.
Antimicrobial properties of 6-pentyl-α-pyrone produced by endophytic strains of Trichoderma koningii and its effect on aflatoxin B1 production,"A total of 60 endophytic fungal strains were isolated and screened for their producing-ability of 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6PP), which has a coconut-like aroma. Of these isolated strains, four strains of Trichoderma koningii Oudemans were positive for 6PP production. Agar well diffusion assay was employed to test the antimicrobial activity of 6PP against 22 microbial strains. Although 6PP showed no antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains, it interestingly exhibited positive inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus recording a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 μg/mL. The 6PP displayed a good antifungal activity against all filamentous fungi tested with MICs ranged from 80 to 90 μg.mL. To demonstrate its mode of antimicrobial activity, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium expansum and Fusarium acuminatum were treated with 6PP at sub-MICs and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Several morphological alterations were caused by 6PP, such as induction of a bleb-like structure on the outer surface of the treated bacteria and surface depression with loosing hyphal linearity of the treated fungi. Additionally, several extensive cellular damages were also observed in microbial cells and the most frequent alteration noticed was the detachment of plasma membrane from cell wall. The inhibitory activity of 6PP was further demonstrated on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by several strains of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus grown in liquid medium and results showed that 6PP had a good efficacy in suppression of AFB1 by 34.28–54.63%. These findings hold a promise to control pathogenic organisms and their toxicity using a lactone metabolite."
"Effect of NaCl stress on physiological, antioxidant enzymes and anatomical responses of Astragalus gombiformis","The current study was carried out to check the influence of the gradient saline (0, 50, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM NaCl) on Astragalus gombiformis Pomel. plants grown in pots in greenhouse conditions. The results demonstrated that salt levels above 50 mM substantially reduced the biomass accumulation in both roots and especially in shoots. Similarly, higher salinity (100–300 mM NaCl) resulted significant decline in net photosynthetic (-66.2%), transpiration (-80%), stomatal conductance (-87.7%), intercellular CO2 concentration (-78.1%) and chlorophyll a and b contents (-45.7 and -51%, respectively). Also, leaf relative water content (RWC) was reduced significantly with salinity exceeding 100 mM NaCl, while the leaf water potential (ΨW) decreased significantly as salinity rises. Salt stress increases Na+, Na+/K+ and decreases K+ concentrations in all tissues of A. gombiformis. Compensatory, an accumulation of organic osmolytes such as soluble sugars in response to higher salinity (150–300 mM NaCl) was observed, while proline content increased drastically with progressive salinity. The present study reveals that GPX and GR were highly used to protect from NaCl-induced H2O2. APX might to participate efficiently in restriction of oxidative damages under higher salinity (50–150 mM). The leaf anatomy showed an increase in upper epidermal thickness at higher salt level (300 mM), whereas the total leaf thickness and the mesophyll parenchyma area decreased with salinity exceeding 100 mM NaCl. The distance between vascular bundle and the xylem vessel diameter were reduced only at 300 mM. The stomatal density decreased with enhanced stomata size at 200–300 mM NaCl. Based on these physiological, biochemical and anatomical responses to salinity we conclude that A. gombiformis is unable to maintain the ionic homeostasis and to managing ROS stress at high salinity and therefore can tolerate only mild to moderate salinity."
Effects of roads and adjacent areas on diversity of terrestrial isopods of Hungarian highway verges,"Transportation infrastructure may be the most important driver of social and economic development, but it is a major cause of environmental change in landscapes. The main objective of this paper is to report road edge effects on isopods of Hungarian highway verges. We examined the isopod diversity along five highways (M0, M1, M3, M5, M7) while accounting for road edge proximity and the adjacent areas. Double-glass pitfall traps were set in a total of 15 sites and at three distances from the edge of the roads next to different types of adjacent areas. We found differences between ecological parameters of isopod communities in relation to adjacent areas as well as to road edge proximity. The highest diversity was observed near urban areas, while the lowest was near the arable fields. Isopod diversity increased with decreasing distance from a road. Species diversity of different types of verges based on adjacent areas varied strongly in relation to road edge proximity. A medium distance (40 m) from roads had a positive effect on species richness, while verges next to arable fields were the most species-rich habitats. The general conclusion of this study is that highway verges provided suitable environment conditions for generalist isopod species but may be a limiting factor for specialist isopods. Moreover, highway verges function as corridors for isopods. The proximity of roads and urban areas positively affected isopods, and verges close to roads and urban areas are considered as an attractive environment for isopods in heterogeneous roadside verges."
Determining the trophic linkage of the red-crowned crane Grus japonensis in Zhalong wetland in northeastern China,"The trophic relations of the red-crowned crane in Zhalong wetland, northeastern China may significantly be altered due to the rapid decrease in accessible food resources. To confirm this hypothesis, we determined the trophic status of this vulnerable species by using stable isotope (carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) methods. The δ13Cand 15Nsignatures in the red-crowned crane species were in the range of −17.8‰to −18.5‰and 6.9‰to 8.1‰, respectively. The majority of the ecosystem of Zhalong wetland has an average food-chain length of 3.9, and the trophic level of the examined species, i.e., red-crowned crane, was approximately 3.1. The trophic relations of red-crowned cranes have changed over the period of 2004 to 2014, as the biological species in the bottom trophic level significantly exhausted in the past years. The conflict of food demand by red-crowned cranes versus the livelihood demand of local wetland residents should be resolved to ensure sustainability of food supply sustainable for rare and extinguishable species."
Relations between tree canopy composition and understorey vegetation in a European beech-sessile oak old growth forest in Western Romania,"The diversity relationship between tree and herb layer has often been investigated, but the results are contradictory. Moreover, few studies of deciduous European species have been conducted to date in natural or near-natural forests, while such studies in old-growth forest with considerable co-dominance of oak are missing."
Comparison of the Production and Chemical Constituents of Five Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. Accessions,"An open field experiment was carried out with five purple Perilla frutescens accessions (588P, GB, J3, JTD3, PS3) in 2014 and 2015. Morphological traits, production, total phenolic content (TPC), essential oil content (EOC) and composition as well as the antioxidant capacity (AOC) were investigated. Highest biomass was produced by JTD3 in both years. The antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content in the stems was lower than in the leaves in all accessions. Leaves of accession GB produced the highest AOC values (215.594 ± 1.437 in 2014 and 86.609 ± 3.602 mg AAE g−1 in 2015, respectively) while the strain 588P showed the lowest values (139.544 ± 1.934 in 2014 and 38.966 ± 4.569 mg AAE g−1 in 2015, respectively). The highest TPC values were measured by PS3 in 2014 (204.320 ± 1.822 mg GAE g−1) and GB in 2015 (136.450 ± mg GAE g−1). The 588P produced the highest essential oil content (1.432 ml 100 g−1 DM) while J3 had the lowest (0.144 ml 100 g−1 DM) in both years. Strong positive correlation was found between the density of glandular hairs and the essential oil content. Three accessions (588P, J3, JTD3) belong to the perillaldehyde chemotype while GB and PS3 to the dehydro elsholtzia ketone chemotype. All studied accessions can be cultivated in Hungary. For the biomass production the JTD3, while for the essential oil production the 588P can be recommended."
How Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Influence the Defense System of Sunflower During Different Abiotic Stresses,"The association between terrestrial plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is one of the most common and widespread mutualistic plant-fungi interaction. AM fungi are of beneficial effects on the water and nutrient uptake of plants and increase plant defense mechanisms to alleviate different stresses. The aim of this study was to determine the level of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), guaiacol peroxidase (POX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activities and to track the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal system under temperature- and mechanical stress conditions. Our results suggest that induced tolerance of mycorrhizal sunflower to high temperature may be attributed to the induction of GST, POX and PPO enzyme activities as well as to the elevated expression of GST. However, the degree of tolerance of the plant is significantly influenced by the age which is probably justified by the energy considerations."
In silico Characterisation of Novel Rice Transcripts Differentially Expressed in Phosphorus Deficient Conditions Suggests a Role of These Transcripts in Multiple Abiotic Stresses,"Phosphorus deficiency adversely affects crop productivity. The mechanism of tolerance in plants is not well understood. The current study successfully annotated a set of highly significant (Log2 RPKM ≥3) nine novel sequences up-regulated in P deficient condition identified from a low P tolerant rice genotype. Sequence annotation identified two transcripts (Os01g37260 and Os02g11060) carrying known domains, F-box and WD, respectively. Multiple Expectation maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) revealed presence of conserved domains like D[LP][HY][CL]D[CM][DT]C[AP][DQ][IQ]C, [EH][DN]HN[HS] [ER][FY][EP]I[HN]H which might play a role in phosphorus deficiency tolerance. Analysis of the upstream regions indicated presence of stress responsive elements like E Box, ABRE, and MYBCORE suggesting regulation of the novel transcripts by DNA binding. Protein localization prediction tool suggests that these novel proteins might be targeted to nucleus, chloroplast and cell wall. Transcripts Os02g03640 and Os02g10250 revealed potential target sites for microRNA binding suggesting role of novel miRNAs in low phosphorus response. Our analysis suggests that an F-box protein, Os01g37260 (OSFBx14) might be a promising candidate gene playing a role in multiple abiotic stresses including P deficiency."
Chemical Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of the Commercial Origanum onites L. Oil Against Nosocomial Carbapenem Resistant Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase Producer Escherichia coli Isolates,"In recent years rapidly growing antibiotic resistance has increased interest toward natural products, especially essential oils because of their various effects. The aim of this study was to identify the chemical composition of the commercial Origanum onites essential oil (EO) and to investigate the antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and dilution methods, against ten different ATCC strains, including eight bacteria, two yeasts and seventy-nine clinical nosocomial Escherichia coli isolates that produce extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The chemical composition of EO was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The major compounds of the EO were determined as carvacrol (51.4%) followed by linalool (11.2%), p-cymene (8.9%) and γ-terpinene (6.7%). O. onites EO had antimicrobial activity against all standard strains and inhibited microbial growth of ESBL positive E. coli isolates. According to our results, O. onites EO may be an alternative to synthetic drug, used in combination with other antibiotics for treatment of infection caused by multidrug resistant bacteria after testing toxic effects and irritation at preferred doses on human."
In vivo Screening of Diterpene Alkaloids using Bdelloid Rotifer Assays,"The group of diterpene alkaloids contains numerous compounds with complex chemistry and diverse pharmacological activities. Beside toxicity, these compounds possess activity on the cardiovascular system, tumor cell lines and nervous system. The pharmacological properties have been described using in vitro and in vivo techniques; however, the bioactivities of many compounds have not thoroughly been studied. Here we report on the in vivo evaluation of ten diterpene alkaloids using bdelloid rotifer assays. Napelline exerted toxic effects on rotifers, while wide tolerance range was observed for other investigated compounds. Weak toxicity of songorine is supported by our experiment. Toxicological data for senbusine A, senbusine C, septentrioidine and hetisinone are reported for the first time."
"Assessment of anthropogenic, seasonal and aquatic vegetation effects on the contamination level of oxbows","The contamination level of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects. The aim of our study was to identify those abiotic and biotic factors that determine the contamination level of oxbows. The effect of anthropogenic activities, seasonality, and vegetation types was studied on the contamination level of surface water of oxbows. The following chemical variables were measured: suspended solid, ammonium, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr and Zn from eight oxbows from 2013 summer to 2014 autumn in the Upper Tisza region in Eastern Hungary. Three of the studied oxbows were protected, four oxbows were used for fishing and one oxbow was contaminated with wastewater. Our findings revealed that anthropogenic activities had remarkable effect on the contamination level of oxbows. Seasonality also influenced the contamination level, except the concentration of suspended solid, chlorophyll-a and manganese. Significant differences were found among vegetation types for the concentration of suspended solids, aluminium, iron, manganese and lead. The high level of iron concentration was not explained by the anthropogenic activities, suggesting that the quality of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects."
Recoding and multidimensional analyses of vegetation data: a comparison,"Two simulated coenoclines and a real data set were differently recoded with respect to the Braun-Blanquet coding (including presence/absence) and analysed through the most common multidimensional scaling methods. This way, we aim at contributing to the debate concerning the nature of the Braun-Blanquet coding and the consequent multidimensional scaling methods to be used. Procrustes, Pearson, and Spearman correlation matrices were computed to compare the resulting sets of coordinates and synthesized through their Principal Component Analyses (PCA). In general, both Procrustes and Pearson correlations showed high coherence of the obtained results, whereas Spearman correlation values were much lower. This proves that the main sources of variation are similarly identified by most of used methods/transformations, whereas less agreement results on the continuous variations along the detected gradients. The conclusion is that Correspondence Analysis on presence/absence data seems the most appropriate method to use. Indeed, presence/absence data are not affected by species cover estimation error and Simple Correspondence Analysis performs really well with this coding. As alternative, Multiple Correlation Analysis provides interesting information on the species distribution while showing a pattern of relevés very similar to that issued by PCA."
Ground-level predation on artificial caterpillars indicates no enemy-free time for lepidopteran larvae,"Lepidoptera is one of the most diverse orders of insects, their larvae are very abundant in many habitats, and frequent prey of various predators. To decrease predation risk, caterpillars developed several means of defence, among them timing their activity to avoid predators (seeking enemy-free time). Although the enemy-free time hypothesis is often invoked to explain caterpillar behaviour, empirical evidence for it is scarce. We tested whether such enemy-free time exists in a temperate forest by comparing predation pressure on artificial caterpillars during day and night on the ground in forest fragments in Denmark. We found a high predation rate, 23.9%d−1, and higher predation rate at night (30.9%d−0.5) than during the day (17.0%d−0.5), both by invertebrate (23.3%d−0.5 vs. 12.4%d−0.5) and vertebrate (8.5%d−0.5 vs. 3.3%d−0.5) predators. The most important predators were chewing insects (73.4% of all attacks) and small mammals (19.0%). Attack rates on red caterpillars were higher (30.0%d−1) than on green ones (19.5%d−1). Overall, these data do not support the idea that night activity can provide enemy-free time for solitary caterpillars on the temperate forest floor."
Does a plant detect its neighbor if it is kin or stranger? Evidence from a common garden experiment,"Unlike vagile organisms, plants perform a wide range of phenotypic responses to cope with environmental stresses. A special case of interaction with external factors is the ability of plants to recognize genetic relatedness of neighbour plants, actually well known as kin recognition. The present work aimed to provide a valuable contribution to the field of kin recognition in plants through a common garden experiment. To avoid bias involved in pot experiments, we perform an experiment in unconstrained root growth conditions comparing the development of coupled kin, non-kin and solitary plants of Xanthium italicum. Biometrics of plants with different genetic relatedness were measured, then architecture and competitive interaction were assessed using the relative interaction index (RII) for above and belowground portions of plants. X. italicum showed different allocation depending on the neighbourhood. Root biomass was declined in plants growing with kin compared to non-kin coupled plants, while plants coupled with kin allocated more shoot than roots compared to solitary plants. RII explains phenotypic response of decreased competition in roots rather than in shoots. Despite high values of RII for the aboveground portion, the architectural analysis of shoot, number, angle and length of branches and roots reveals dramatic but indistinctive change in the structure of plants growing near kin or non kin compared to a solitary plant. These results confirm phenotypic responses of kin recognition in unconstrained environment."
Analysis of the effects of mineral fertilization on species diversity and yield of permanent grasslands: revisited data to mediate economic and environmental needs,"The 2013 reform of the European Common Agricultural Policy tries to support farmers willing to follow environment- friendly rural practices, by the so called “green payment”. Within this framework, it is suggested that governments and regions should maintain a certain ratio of the area of permanent grasslands to the total Utilized Agricultural Area according to the greening rules of the reform. However, the weak economic performance of permanent grasslands does not encourage farmers to invest into their conservation. This fact persuaded us to revisit our old unpublished data, obtained by experiments on the use of chemical fertilizers in permanent grasslands. By this reanalysis we hope to further support the new European policy with the perspective to find a trade-off between the conservation of the biodiversity and the economic productivity of permanent grasslands. Of the many possibilities we have chosen to present the results of two experiments, one in Italy and the other in Slovakia. The main reason for this choice was that these two studies followed complementary strategies of fertilization that appeared useful to detect both the single and the synergistic effects of N, P, and K on the relationships between yield and species diversity. The results of cluster and diversity analysis suggest that chemical fertilization should be carefully planned according to soil conditions, since different treatments may have the same effect on the floristic and vegetation patterns of grasslands. These results, according to similarity theory, allow to choose the least expensive and polluting combination of N, P and K from those that, according to the species combinations, are assigned to the same cluster."
Dual-Wavelength Thin-Layer Chromatographic—Densitometric Determination of Febuxostat in Combination with Acetaminophen in Synthetic Mixture and in Pharmaceutical Formulations,"The combination of xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat (FBX) with acetaminophen (ACE) is widely used in the treatment of gout. A rapid, simple, selective, and precise densitometric method was developed and validated for the simultaneous estimation of FBX—ACE mixture in a synthetic binary mixture and in their pharmaceutical dosage forms. The method employed thin-layer chromatography (TLC) aluminum plates precoated with silica gel G 60 F254 as the stationary phase using chloroform—methanol—cyclohexane—acetic acid 96% (7:1:1:0.1, v/v) as the mobile phase. The optimized mobile phase selected for development gave compact bands (RFvalues were 0.65 and 0.46 for FBX and ACE, respectively). Spectrodensitometric scanning integration was performed using dual-wavelength detection at 320 and 250 nm for FBX and ACE, respectively. The linear regression data for the calibration plots showed excellent linear relationship (r = 0.9997 and 0.9992 for FBX and ACE, respectively). The method was validated for precision, accuracy, robustness, and recovery. The limits of detection and quantification were calculated. The statistical analysis proved that the method is reproducible and selective for the estimation of this binary mixture."
Helicobacter pylori infection and prevalence of high blood pressure among Chinese adults,"Epidemiological studies demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. However, the association between H. pylori infection and hypertension remained unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between H. pylori infection and prevalence of hypertension among Chinese adults. We performed a cross-sectional study of 5246 adult participants who were recruited from a health manage center. All participants underwent a 13C-urea breath test and a routine health check-up. Logistic and liner regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypertension in relation to H. pylori infection. Of the 5168 study participants aged 18–70 years, 2034 (39.4%) were females and 955 (18.5%) had hypertension. After adjustment for potential confounders, H. pylori infection was associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04, 1.46). In addition, compared with participants not infected with H. pylori, those with H. pylori infection had an increase of 0.735 mmHg (95% CI, 0.101, 1.369) for diastolic blood pressure and 0.723 mmHg (95% CI, 0.034, 1.413) for mean arterial pressure. There was no significant interaction between H. pylori infection and age, sex, and body mass index on the prevalence of hypertension (all P values for interaction >0.05). Findings from this study demonstrate that H. pylori infection was positively associated with prevalence of hypertension among Chinese adults. More well-designed studies are warranted to confirm our findings."
Rerouting the internal thoracic pedicle: a novel solution for maxillofacial reconstruction in vessel-depleted situations? A preliminary anatomic study,"Microsurgical reconstruction in a vessel-depleted neck is a challenge due to the lack of reliable vessels in or nearby the host site. The use of the internal thoracic pedicle (ITP) by rib section or sparring is a limited option due to the small length of the pedicle of some flaps. However, in cardiac surgery, the internal thoracic artery (ITA) is widely used for myocardial revascularization, providing a long and versatile pedicle. We aimed at determining precise anatomical bases for the use of the ITP, approached by sternotomy and rerouted in the neck, as recipient vessels for free-flap facial reconstructions."
Immunological hallmarks of cis-DDP-resistant Lewis lung carcinoma cells,"Tumor cell resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents is one of the major hurdles to successful cancer treatment with these drugs, and is associated with alterations in tumor cell immune evasion and immunomodulatory properties. Immunocyte targeting is considered as a relevant approach to fight drug-resistant cancer. In this study, immunological hallmarks of cis-DDP-resistant Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC/R9) were investigated."
Abundance and Species Diversity of Fungi in Rivers with Various Contaminations,"The main objective of this work was to determine the abundance and species diversity of fungi in the waters of selected rivers of Central Europe, NE Poland (Augustów Lakeland), differing in size, physical and chemical properties, and streamflow rate. The minimum abundance of fungi in the analysed rivers was recorded for a river with low concentration of organic matter (8200 CFU/mL, Czarna Hańcza River), and maximum for a strongly anthropogenically polluted river (24,800 CFU/mL, Kamienny Bród River). A total of 49 fungal species were identified based on PCR ITS-RFLP and DNA sequencing methods. However, RFLP-PCR method has proved to be sufficient to determine the species of 34 fungi. The highest taxonomic diversity was determined for the waters abundant in organic matter (Piecówka and Rospuda Rivers), and the lowest for rivers poor in organic matter (Netta and Czarna Hańcza Rivers). From the 49 identified species, 47% were aquatic hyphomycetes, and 18% were potentially pathogenic fungi mainly occurring in the waters of polluted rivers with increased organic matter concentrations. Moreover, a higher number of fungal taxa were recorded in fluvial waters distinguished by higher streamflow rate, and therefore, stronger water turbulence. The study results suggest that the most important factors influencing the structure of mycoplankton in rivers include pH of water, content of organic matter, degree of anthropogenic pollution, and streamflow rate."
Aeromicrobium panacisoli sp. nov. Isolated from Soil of Ginseng Cultivating Field,"A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium (Gsoil 137T) was isolated from soil of a ginseng field of Pocheon province in South Korea and subjected to a polyphasic approach in order to determine its taxonomic position. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain Gsoil 137T was shown to belong to the family Nocardioidaceae and was closely related to Aeromicrobium ginsengisoli Gsoil 098T (96.7%), Aeromicrobium panaciterrae (96.7%), and Aeromicrobium halocynthiae JCM 15749T (96.6%). Being phylogenetic, it was most closely related to Aeromicrobium halocynthiae JCM 15749T. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 70.3 mol%. The diagnostic diamino acid of the cell wall peptidoglycan was LL-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinone was menaquinone MK-8 (H4) and MK-7 (H4) was a minor compound. The major cellular fatty acids were C14:0, C16:0, C18:1 ω9c and summed feature 4 (C16:1 ω7c/C15:0 iso 2-OH). All these data supported the affiliation of strain Gsoil 137T to the genus Aeromicrobium. The results of physiological and biochemical tests enabled strain Gsoil 137T to be differentiated genotypically and phenotypically from currently known Aeromicrobium species. Therefore, strain Gsoil 137T represents a novel species of the genus Aeromicrobium, for which the name Aeromicrobium panacisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gsoil 137T (= KCTC 19130T = DSM 17940T = CCUG 52475T)."
Risk Factors for Mortality and Morbidity in Elderly Patients Presenting with Digestive Surgical Emergencies,Emergency digestive surgery is being increasingly performed in elderly patients. The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of mortality and morbidity following emergency digestive surgery in patients aged 80 years and older.
Antireflux Surgery in the USA: Influence of Surgical Volume on Perioperative Outcomes and Costs—Time for Centralization?,Few studies have analyzed the relationship between surgical volume and outcomes after antireflux procedures. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgical volume on postoperative results and costs for patients undergoing surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
"Evaluation of perioperative prophylaxis with fosfomycin tromethamine in ureteroscopic stone removal: an investigator-driven prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study","To compare efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of fosfomycin tromethamine with other standard-of-care antibiotics in patients undergoing ureteroscopic lithotripsy."
Convective Stability of Vertical Throughflow of a Non-Newtonian Fluid in a Porous Channel with Soret Effect,"The linear stability analysis of vertical throughflow of power law fluid for double-diffusive convection with Soret effect in a porous channel is investigated in this study. The upper and lower boundaries are assumed to be permeable, isothermal and isosolutal. The linear stability of vertical through flow is influenced by the interactions among the non-Newtonian Rayleigh number (Ra), Buoyancy ratio (N), Lewis number (Le), Péclet number (Pe), Soret parameter (Sr) and power law index (n). The results indicate that the Soret parameter has a significant influence on convective instability of power law fluid. It has also been noticed that buoyancy ratio has a dual effect on the instability of fluid flow. Further, it is noticed that the basic temperature and concentration profiles have singularities at \(Pe = 0\) and \(Le = 1\), the convective instability is looked into for the limiting case of \(Pe\rightarrow 0\) and \(Le \rightarrow 1\). For the case of pure thermal convection with no vertical throughflow, the present numerical results coincide with the solution of standard Horton–Rogers–Lapwood problem. The present results for critical Rayleigh number obtained using bvp4c and two-term Galerkin approximation are compared with those available in the literature and are tabulated."
A note on hydrodynamics from dissipative particle dynamics,"We calculate current correlation functions (CCFs) of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and compare them with results of molecular dynamics (MD) and solutions of linearized hydrodynamic equations. In particular, we consider three versions of DPD, the empirical/classical DPD, coarse-grained (CG) DPD with radial-direction interactions only and full (radial, transversal, and rotational) interactions between particles. To facilitate quantitative discussions, we consider specifically a star-polymer melt system at a moderate density. For bonded molecules, it is straightforward to define the CG variables and to further derive CG force fields for DPD within the framework of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. For both transversal and longitudinal current correlation functions (TCCFs and LCCFs), we observe that results of MD, DPD, and hydrodynamic solutions agree with each other at the continuum limit. Below the continuum limit to certain length scales, results of MD deviate significantly from hydrodynamic solutions, whereas results of both empirical and CG DPD resemble those of MD. This indicates that the DPD method with Markovian force laws possibly has a larger applicability than the continuum description of a Newtonian fluid. This is worth being explored further to represent generalized hydrodynamics."
Fluctuating hydrodynamic methods for fluid-structure interactions in confined channel geometries,We develop computational methods for the study of fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations when confined within channels with slit-like geometry. The methods take into account the hydrodynamic coupling and diffusivity of microstructures when influenced by their proximity to no-slip walls. We develop stochastic numerical methods subject to no-slip boundary conditions using a staggered finite volume discretization. We introduce techniques for discretizing stochastic systems in a manner that ensures results consistent with statistical mechanics. We show how an exact fluctuation-dissipation condition can be used for this purpose to discretize the stochastic driving fields and combined with an exact projection method to enforce incompressibility. We demonstrate our computational methods by investigating how the proximity of ellipsoidal colloids to the channel wall affects their active hydrodynamic responses and passive diffusivity. We also study for a large number of interacting particles collective drift-diffusion dynamics and associated correlation functions. We expect the introduced stochastic computational methods to be broadly applicable to applications in which confinement effects play an important role in the dynamics of microstructures subject to hydrodynamic coupling and thermal fluctuations.
Mesoscale modeling of microgel mechanics and kinetics through the swelling transition,"The mechanics and swelling kinetics of polymeric microgels are simulated using a mesoscale computational model based on dissipative particle dynamics. Microgels are represented by a random elastic network submerged in an explicit viscous solvent. The model is used to probe the effect of different solvent conditions on the bulk modulus of the microgels. Comparison of the simulation results through the volume phase transition reveals favorable agreement with Flory-Rehner’s theory for polymeric gels. The model is also used to examine the microgel swelling kinetics, and is found to be in good agreement with Tanaka’s theory for spherical gels. The simulations show that, during the swelling process, the microgel maintains a nearly homogeneous structure, whereas deswelling is characterized by the formation of chain bundles and network coarsening."
Trajectory tracking control of robot manipulator based on RBF neural network and fuzzy sliding mode,"Aimed at the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the manipulator system, a RBF (radial basis function) neural network-based fuzzy sliding-mode control method was proposed in this paper, in order to make the manipulator track the given trajectory at an ideal dynamic quality. In this method, the equivalent part of the sliding-mode control is approximated by the RBF neural network, in which no model information is required. Meanwhile, a fuzzy controller is developed to make adaptive adjustment of the sliding-mode control’s switching gains according to the distance between the current motor point and the sliding-mode surface, thus effectively the problem of chattering is solved. This method has, to some extent, improved the performance of response and tracking, and reduced the time of adjustment and chattering of input control. The system stability is verified by Lyapunov’s theorem. The simulation result suggests that the algorithm designed for the three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) manipulator system is effective."
An efficient categorization of liver cirrhosis using convolution neural networks for health informatics,"Accurate categorization of cirrhosis liver image in ultrasound modality is of great importance in medical diagnosis and treatment. Health informatics is important as it provides quick predictions on diseases based on nearness of symptoms. Modelling solutions for the same on cloud using deep learning is the motivation of this paper. Here, we propose a deep learning model associated with correlation based feature selection method for cirrhosis image classification. We compare the results with three other conventional classifiers algorithms to improve the better classification accuracy. First in pre-processing stage, noises are eliminated from pathological scan images by using modified laplacian pyramid non-linear diffusion filter. From the pre-processed scan images, each cirrhosis region is obtained under the guidance of radiology or physicians. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch by gray level, local binary pattern and scale invariant feature, a feature selection technique is applied to choice the predominant texture features for each classifier. Finally a convolution neural network is implemented to improve the performance of classifiers in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Convolution neural network algorithm with two hidden layers gives more accuracy in classifying cirrhosis image with 98% sensitivity. Experiments are carried out with 990 cirrhosis image patches which demonstrates that our proposed deep learning classifier perform 100% well than original classifiers in terms of accuracy."
"Influences of cold atmospheric plasma on microbial safety, physicochemical and sensorial qualities of meat products","Meat and meat products can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms, which cause serious health problems and economic loss. Recently, numerous novel non-thermal technologies have been developed to respond to growing consumer demand for high quality and safe meat products. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a novel and emerging non-thermal technology, showing great potential for applications in the food industry. This review presents recent advances on the developments and applications of CAP in meat products, including generation and microbial inactivation effects of CAP as well as its influences on physicochemical qualities and sensory attributes of meat products. Furthermore, the safety assessment of CAP-treated meat products and challenges in industrial application of CAP are also discussed."
The adaptability of a wetland plant species Myriophyllum aquaticum to different nitrogen forms and nitrogen removal efficiency in constructed wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) cultivated with Myriophyllum aquaticum showed great potential for total nitrogen (TN) removal from aquatic ecosystems in previous studies. To evaluate the growth characteristics, photosynthetic pigment content, and antioxidative responses of M. aquaticum, as well as its TN removal efficiency in CWs, M. aquaticum was treated with different levels of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) for 28 days. The results indicated that M. aquaticum had strong nitrogen stress tolerance and was more likely to be suppressed by high levels of NH4+ than NO3−. High levels of NH4+ also led to inhibition of synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and increased peroxidase activity in plant leaves, which was not found in the NO3− treatments. High levels of both NH4+ and NO3− generated obvious oxidative stress through elevation of malondialdehyde content while decreasing superoxide dismutase activity in the early stage. A sustainable increase of TN removal efficiency in most of the CWs indicated that M. aquaticum was a candidate species for treating wastewater with high levels of nitrogen because of its higher tolerance for NH4+ and NO3− stress. However, the increase of TN removal efficiency was hindered in the late stage when treated with high levels of NH4+ of 26 and 36 mmol/L, indicating that its tolerance to NH4+ stress might have a threshold. The results of this study will enrich the studies on detoxification of high ammonium ion content in NH4+-tolerant submerged plants and supply valuable reference data for proper vegetation of M. aquaticum in CWs."
The impacts of the axial-to-radial airflow quantity ratio and suction distance on air curtain dust control in a fully mechanized coal face,"To understand the impacts of the axial-to-radial airflow quantity ratio (denoted as R) and the suction distance (denoted as Ds) on air curtain dust control in a fully mechanized coal face, the 3down610 coal face in Jiangzhuang coal mine was numerically simulated in this study. A mathematic model was established to describe the airflow migration and dust diffusion in a coal face, and a scaled physical model was constructed. The comparison between simulation results and field measurements validated the model and the parameter settings. Furthermore, the airflow migration and dust diffusion at various R and Ds are analyzed using Ansys CFD. The results show that a reduction of R and Ds is conducive to the formation of an effective axial dust control air curtain; the dust diffusion distance decreases with the decrease of both R and Ds. By analyzing the simulation results, the optimal parameter for air curtain dust control in the 3down610 coal face and those faces with similar production conditions is determined as R = 1/9 and Ds = 2 m. Under the optimal parameter condition, the high-concentration dust can be confined in front of the mining driver within a space 5.8 m away from the coal face."
Removal mechanism of di-n-butyl phthalate and oxytetracycline from aqueous solutions by nano-manganese dioxide modified biochar,"In this work, nano-manganese dioxide (nMnO2)-modified biochar (BC) was synthesized in order to improve BC’s adsorption capacity for di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and oxytetracycline (OTC). The results showed that nMnO2 on the BC surface exhibited a poor crystallinity and oxidation state (Mn (IV)). Sorption experiments showed that, compared to BC, DBP sorption capacity of nMnO2-BC (1:20) and OTC sorption capacity of nMnO2-BC (1:10) were 0.0364 and 0.0867 mmol/g, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of BC (0.0141 and 0.0151 mmol/g). Kinetics and isotherm experiments indicated that physical adsorption and chemical interactions have both exerted their impacts on the adsorption process. Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that part of the Mn (IV) in nMnO2-BC was reduced to Mn (III) and Mn (II) after DBP or OTC adsorption. Therefore, we suggest the nMnO2 also acted as an oxidizer on modified BC, which may accelerate the degradation of DBP and OTC."
"Autonomy, Well-Being, and the Value of Genetic Testing for Adopted Persons","This paper argues that the value of genetic-relative family health history (GRFHx) information and the notion that lack of this information is a disadvantage can be established through its role as a nested goal in comprehensive life projects independent of documentation of particular health outcomes. Health information often plays a significant role in a person's formulation of life goals and projects, as well as in identification of plausible effective means to realize these goals. If health outcomes are valuable in part because of the nested role these play in the successful realization of a person's life projects and goals, then other, similarly nested contributors to such success must also be valued on a similar scale. Some of these other contributors to a successful life may themselves be nested with health considerations, as illustrated in the relationship that will be the focus of this paper. Health information --independent of outcomes per se – influences relationships, reproduction, and the formulation of plausible comprehensive life goals in intricate and very influential ways. Although such information may be valued in part because it is predictive of health outcomes, this relationship does not reduce such information, nor the comprehensive life goals and projects such information promotes, to health outcomes. That is, while health status can both enhance and detract from the autonomous (successful) pursuit of life projects formulated in the context of health information, the value and weight of these projects is independent of particular health status or outcomes, even while in part shaped by them."
Mechanism of Neuroprotection Against Experimental Spinal Cord Injury by Riluzole or Methylprednisolone,"Any spinal cord injury carries the potential for persistent disability affecting motor, sensory and autonomic functions. To prevent this outcome, it is highly desirable to block a chain of deleterious reactions developing in the spinal areas immediately around the primary lesion. Thus, early timing of pharmacological neuroprotection should be one major strategy whose impact may be first studied with preclinical models. Using a simple in vitro model of the rat spinal cord it is possible to mimic pathological processes like excitotoxicity that damages neurons because of excessive glutamate receptor activation due to injury, or hypoxic/dysmetabolic insult that preferentially affects glia following vascular dysfunction. While ongoing research is exploring the various components of pathways leading to cell death, current treatment principally relies on the off-label use of riluzole (RLZ) or methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS). The mechanism of action of these drugs is diverse as RLZ targets mainly neurons and MPSS targets glia. Even when applied after a transient excitotoxic stimulus, RLZ can provide effective prevention of secondary excitotoxic damage to premotoneurons, although not to motoneurons that remain very vulnerable. This observation indicates persistent inability to express locomotor activity despite pharmacological treatment conferring some histological protection. MPSS can protect glia from dysmetabolic insult, yet it remains poorly effective to prevent neuronal death. In summary, it appears that these pharmacological agents can produce delayed protection for certain cell types only, and that their combined administration does not provide additional benefit. The search should continue for better, mechanism-based neuroprotective agents."
Bond Supply and Excess Bond Returns in Zero-Lower Bound and Normal Environments: Evidence from Japan,"We estimate a discrete-time version of the Vayanos and Vila (2009) preferred-habitat model, using Japanese government bond yield data. The estimated results indicate that bond excess returns become more sensitive to bond supply in the absence of a zero lower bound constraint unless arbitrageurs become willing to take on more risk."
Intergenerational Wealth Elasticity in Japan,"This study estimates the intergenerational wealth elasticity using original Japanese survey data and assesses factors explaining the intergenerational wealth elasticity, such as income, educational level, bequests and preferences. The age-adjusted elasticity of child wealth with respect to parental wealth ranges from 0.266 to 0.367, and transition matrices indicate that the intergenerational transmission of wealth persists more strongly in the tails of the distributions. The correlation between parent and child wealth mainly stems from income, education and bequests, which jointly constitute 63.9% of the wealth elasticity."

Fabrication and characterization of multi-layer InAs/InGaAs quantum dot p-i-n GaAs solar cells grown on silicon substrates,"This paper reports on InAs/InGaAs quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on (001) n-type silicon (n-Si) substrates. In-situ RHEED measurements show that InAs/InGaAs QDs SC has a high crystalline structure. The dislocation density in the active layer of the InAs/InGaAs QDSC and the lattice mismatch in the GaAs layer can be reduced by using an Si rough surface buffer layer (RSi). To show the effect of the QD layers, a reference SC with the same p-i-n structure as the InAs/InGaAs QDSC, but without InAs QDs, is also grown. The two SCs were studied by sepectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), in the 1–6 eV photon energy range, photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements. The optical constants of the two devices are determined in the photon energy range 1–6 eV from the SE data. The dominant features in the dielectric function spectra at ~ 3 and ~ 4.5 eV are attributed, respectively, to the E1 and E2 critical point structures of GaAs and InAs. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectrum of the InAs/InGaAs QDSC shows ground-state emissions, respectively, from the relatively small QDs near 1081 nm and from the large QDs near 1126 nm. Photocurrent measurements confirm the improved absorption performance (up to 1200 nm) of the InAs QDs SC which is ascribed to the optical absorption from the InAs/InGaAs QDs and the Si substrate as demonstrated by SE and photoluminescence measurements."
"Phase I trial to evaluate the addition of alisertib to fulvestrant in women with endocrine-resistant, ER+ metastatic breast cancer","In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer models, activation of Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is associated with downregulation of ERα expression and resistance to endocrine therapy. Alisertib is an oral selective inhibitor of AURKA. The primary objectives of this phase I trial were to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate the toxicities and clinical activity of alisertib combined with fulvestrant in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC)."
Comparative transcriptome analysis of two citrus germplasms with contrasting susceptibility to Phytophthora nicotianae provides new insights into tolerance mechanisms,"Host perception of Phytophthora nicotianae switching to necrotrophy is fundamental for disease tolerance of citrus. It involves an HR-like response, strengthening of the cell wall structure and hormonal signaling."
Study on a neon cryogenic oscillating heat pipe with long heat transport distance,"An experimental study is carried out to study the heat transfer characteristics of a cryogenic oscillating heat pipe (OHP) with long heat transport distance. The OHP is made up of a capillary tube with an inner diameter of 1.0 mm and an outer diameter of 2.0 mm. The working fluid is neon, and the length of the adiabatic section is 480 mm. Tests are performed with the different heat inputs, liquid filling ratios and condenser temperature. For the cryogenic OHP with a liquid filling ratio of 30.7% at the condenser temperature of 28 K, the effective thermal conductivity is 3466–30,854 W/m K, and the maximum transfer power is 35.60 W. With the increment of the heat input, the effective thermal conductivity of the cryogenic OHP increases at the liquid filling ratios of 30.7% and 38.5%, while it first increases and then decreases at the liquid filling ratios of 15.2% and 23.3%. Moreover, the effective thermal conductivity increases with decreasing liquid filling ratio at the small heat input, and the maximum transfer power first increases and then decreases with increasing liquid filling ratio. Finally, it is found that the thermal performance of the cryogenic OHP can be improved by increasing the condenser temperature."
"Bone Geometry, Quality, and Bone Markers in Children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","Adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus show a high risk of bone fracture, probably as a consequence of a decreased bone mass and microarchitectural bone alterations. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential negative effects of type 1 diabetes on bone geometry, quality, and bone markers in a group of children and adolescents. 96 children, mean age 10.5 ± 3.1 years, agreed to participate to the study. Bone geometry was evaluated on digitalized X-rays at the level of the 2nd metacarpal bone. The following parameters were investigated and expressed as SDS: outer diameter (D), inner diameter (d), cortical area (CA), and medullary area (MA). Bone strength was evaluated as Bending Breaking Resistance Index (BBRI) from the geometric data. Bone turnover markers (PINP, CTX-I, and BAP), sclerostin, Dkk-1, PTH, and 25OH-Vitamin D were also assessed. A group of healthy 40 subjects of normal body weight and height served as controls for the bone markers. D (− 0.99 ± 0.98), d (− 0.41 ± 0.88), CA (− 0.85 ± 0.78), and MA (− 0.46 ± 0.78) were all significantly smaller than in controls (p < 0.01). BBRI was significantly lower (− 2.61 ± 2.18; p < 0.0001). PTH, PINP, and BAP were higher in the diabetic children. Multiple regression analysis showed that CA and D were influenced by insulin/Kg/day and by BMI, while d was influenced by PINP only. Type 1 diabetic children show smaller and weaker bones. The increased bone turnover could play a key role since it might amplify the deficit in bone strength associated with the inadequate osteoblastic activity caused by the disease itself."
Rhinoplasty in elderly patients: analysis of outcomes and patient’s satisfaction following 20 years experiences,"Rhinoplasty is one of the most complex procedures in plastic surgery. In patients over 65, the procedure is even more demanding because of the coexistence of multiple complicating psychological and anatomical factors. The aims of our study were to analyze the necessity of rhinoplasty in elderly patients, to analyze the perception of patients before and after procedures and compare these patients with younger population, to review all cases done in our department over the past 20 years, and to summarize all procedures."
Endosymbionts Differentially Alter Exploratory Probing Behavior of a Nonpersistent Plant Virus Vector,"Insect endosymbionts (hereafter, symbionts) can modify plant virus epidemiology by changing the physiology or behavior of vectors, but their role in nonpersistent virus pathosystems remains uninvestigated. Unlike propagative and circulative viruses, nonpersistent plant virus transmission occurs via transient contamination of mouthparts, making direct interaction between symbiont and virus unlikely. Nonpersistent virus transmission occurs during exploratory intracellular punctures with styletiform mouthparts when vectors assess potential host-plant quality prior to phloem feeding. Therefore, we used an electrical penetration graph (EPG) to evaluate plant probing of the cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch, an important vector of cucurbit viruses, in the presence and absence of two facultative, intracellular symbionts. We tested four isolines of A. craccivora: two isolines were from a clone from black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), one infected with Arsenophonus sp. and one cured, and two derived from a clone from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), one infected with Hamiltonella defensa and one cured. We quantified exploratory intracellular punctures, indicated by a waveform potential drop recorded by the EPG, initiation speed and frequency within the initial 15 min on healthy and watermelon mosaic virus-infected pumpkins. Symbiont associations differentially modified exploratory intracellular puncture frequency by aphids, with H. defensa-infected aphids exhibiting depressed probing, and Arsenophonus-infected aphids an increased frequency of probing. Further, there was greater overall aphid probing on virus-infected plants, suggesting that viruses manipulate their vectors to enhance acquisition-transmission rates, independent of symbiont infection. These results suggest facultative symbionts differentially affect plant-host exploration behaviors and potentially nonpersistent virus transmission by vectors."

"Slipped through the bottleneck: Lazarechinus mirabeti gen. et sp. nov., a Paleozoic-like echinoid from the Triassic Muschelkalk (late Anisian) of East France","The unique find of a stem group echinoid with a rotular, flexible corona composed of multiserial ambulacra and interambulacra from the Upper Muschelkalk Calcaire à Entroques (Middle Triassic, late Anisian, late Illyrian) of East France is described. The articulate specimen allows description of all characters besides the apical disc that was lost. The echinoid described as Lazarechinus mirabeti represents a new species and genus of the Carboniferous through Late Permian stem group echinoid family Proterocidaridae. Between the latest Permian proterocidarid Pronechinus and the new Lazarechinus is a gap of approx. 16 Ma covering the Early and early Middle Triassic. This makes the new genus a typical Lazarus taxon belonging to a lineage that disappeared during times of crisis and awoke in times of biotic recovery. Additional references of stem group echinoids are known from the middle Anisian of Southwest China and from the Carnian of Italy and Central China. The new finds provide evidence that the current concepts of echinoid evolution around the Permian–Triassic boundary require thorough reappraisal. The fortunate discovery of Lazarechinus in a Muschelkalk conservation Lagerstätte also encourages the systematic search of isolated sclerites assignable to stem group echinoids in Triassic sediments to provide more information on abundance, distribution, and habitats."
Tempestitic shell beds formed by a new serpulid polychaete from the Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) of the Central High Atlas (Morocco),"Serpulid-dominated shell beds from the Lower Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) of the Central High Atlas (Morocco) are primarily formed by quadrangular tubes of the serpulid polychaete Nogrobs moroccensis sp. nov. The transverse tube ornament consisting predominately of wrinkles, the lack of narrow spirals and the shortness or absence of attached posterior tube portion represent the diagnostic features of this new species. Tubes of Nogrobs moroccensis co-occur with gastropods and oyster–crinoidal debris. We suggest that these serpulids were free-lying in their adult stage and formed benthic meadows on soft-bottom habitats. They frequently show parallel alignment in plane views in both graded and non-graded, few-cm-thick shell beds, corresponding to distal tempestites deposited close to and below storm wave base in an outer-ramp environment. The excellent preservation of serpulids implies short residence time on the seafloor, and the lack of compositional mixing with other communities and their restriction to outer-ramp habitats indicate that they represent parautochthonous assemblages. Analyses of serpulid orientation on the bottom bedding planes of shell beds revealed weak unidirectional arrangement of tubes, whereas orientation on the top bedding planes revealed strong unidirectional arrangement of tubes, with significantly different orientation relative to the bottom planes. This change could suggest a shift from predominantly a current component of the combined storm flow (with uneven seafloor surface and adhesion of skeletal grains to muddy substrate) to significant oscillatory component of the waning storm, as also suggested by bidirectional orientation of gastropods."
Rethinking the effectiveness of family planning in Africa,"For the past 50 years there has been a near global consensus that the demands of development necessitate that couples reduce their fertility as a critical act which would jump start economic growth. This consensus heralded the era of the One Child policy and over 90% of least developed states continue to run programs which seek to induce lower fertility rates in their populations. However, a growing body of literature is questioning both the validity and utility of these interventions. This article seeks to contribute to the rethinking of family planning programs. Using new data on family planning scores from forty two African states this article shows that rates of fertility are unlikely to be affected by the strength of family planning programs at lower levels of development. However, at moderate levels of development, family planning programs may contribute to accelerating the decline in fertility initiated by exogenous factors. These findings offer a fresh perspective on the wide spread adoption of family planning policy that permeates the developing world."
Noise-resilient compressed domain video watermarking system for in-car camera security,"In-car camera system emerges as a very useful technology for automobile drivers, as it can provide proper evidence to insurance companies and to police investigators in case of car accidents. Dashcam, being one of the car video storage devices, stores the data in the SD card which is overwritten and can be tampered very easily. Thus, it is important to develop an in-car security system, where data can be stored in the server and can provide privacy to the user. In this paper, we have proposed a noise-resilient compressed domain video watermarking system for in-car security to document the vehicle history which can be a proof for any mischief. We have used Independent Pass Coding (INPAC) compression technique for designing the system. Here, data generated by the system is stored in the server database which is accessible to the authentic registered user and administrator in case of any claim. This system ensures copyright, proprietorship, authentication and security against third party intrusion. The proposed system is implemented in off-line mode to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, and in online mode to verify the system. Graphical user interface is designed for the end user access, to make it user friendly."
Neo-fuzzy neuron learning using backfitting algorithm,"This paper proposes an automatic and simple approach to design a neo-fuzzy neuron for identification purposes. The proposed approach uses the backfitting algorithm to learn multiple univariate additive models, where each additive model is a zero-order T-S fuzzy system which is a function of one input variable, and there is one additive model for each input variable. The multiple zero-order T-S fuzzy models constitute a neo-fuzzy neuron. The structure of the model used in this paper allows to have results with good interpretability and accuracy. To validate and demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied on 10 benchmark data sets and compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector regression (SVR) algorithms, and two algorithms for design neo-fuzzy neuron systems, an adaptive learning algorithm for a neo-fuzzy neuron systems (ALNFN), and a fuzzy Kolmogorov’s network (FKN). A statistical paired t test analysis is also presented to compare the proposed approach with ELM, SVR, ALNFN, and FKN with the aim to see whether the results of the proposed approach are statistically different from ELM, SVR, ALNFN, and FKN. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms ELM and FKN in all data sets and outperforms SVR and ALNFN in almost all data sets that they were statistically different in almost all data sets and that in most data sets the number of fuzzy rules selected by cross-validation was small obtaining a model with a small complexity and good interpretability capability."
Argon–water system at low temperatures,"The molecular dynamics method is used to simulate argon solutions in water and a thin water film–argon system at low temperatures. The correlation in motions of two closely spaced argon atoms is of another nature than the correlation of two neon atoms in a neon solid solution in ice II. The structure of hydrate shells of argon atoms contains five-membered rings composed of water molecules. The solubility of argon in a water film at low temperatures is noticeably higher than at room temperature. If a water film is first cooled to the glassy state and then argon atoms are added to it, then approximately as many argon atoms are absorbed on the film surface as they are present in a cooled film in equilibrium with the argon atmosphere. Argon atoms migrate from one pit to another on the rough surface of a solid water film."
Molecular dynamics search for magic numbers for silver and copper clusters,"Isothermal molecular dynamics is used to find the magic numbers corresponding to clusters of fcc transition metals: silver and copper. To that end, we use both our own computer program with a tight-binding potential and well-known LAMMPS software whose standard package is designed to model metal systems by the embedded atom method. Regardless of the choice between two relaxation techniques (lowtemperature relaxation at 1 K and the variant involving a gradual temperature decrease with subsequent relaxation at 1 K), magic number 13 is detected that corresponds to the first term of the Chini series. At the same time, other magic numbers are also found that belong and do not belong to this series."
Characteristics of copper sulfide nanoparticles obtained in the copper sulfate–sodium thiosulfate system,"Stable hydrosols of copper sulfide nanoparticles are synthesized by heating aqueous solutions with different ratios of sodium thiosulfate and copper sulfate in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone and studied by a number of physicochemical methods in situ (optical spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering) and ex situ (transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The main product is CuS covellite nanoparticles with some impurities of other phases (Cu2S, Cu1,8S, Cu7S4). With an increase in the initial molar ratio S2O 2−3 / Cu from 0.2 to 5 the nanoparticle size increases from 1-5 nm to 30-50 nm and then decreases to 4 nm at a ratio of 10. A substantial increase in the intensity of plasmon absorption within 800-1500 nm is observed during the formation of planar nanoparticles with a lateral size of about 30 nm at S2O 2−3:Cu = 5. A band gap obtained from both direct and indirect optical absorption spectra of sulfides (2.6 eV and 1.7 eV respectively) remains constant for all particles."
"Self-Perception Theory, Radical Behaviourism, and the Publicity/Privacy Issue","According to Bem’s self-perception theory, people know their own minds in the same way that they know those of others: they infer their own minds by observing their own behavior and the circumstances in which this behavior takes place. Although Bem’s theory seems anti-introspectionistic, it claims that people infer their minds by observing their own behavior only when internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or un-interpretable. This has led some to argue that Bem does not rule out a priori introspective access to the mind and thus introspection as a research method. This paper will discuss self-perception theory and its influence over recent research and will argue that introspection is not an autonomous research method. This is so because of its radical behavioristic outlook, according to which all methods and data of psychology must be public and not private. Then, the paper will discuss the epistemological implications of this behavioristic attitude on psychology. Finally, it will argue in favor of introspection as an autonomous research method and an independent source of data for psychology."
Effects of progressive muscle relaxation training on sleep and quality of life in patients with pulmonary resection,"The inadequate quality and nature of sleep is a commonly reported problem among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation training program on sleep quality, sleep state, pain, and quality of life in patients who underwent pulmonary resection."
Deep recurrent neural network for mobile human activity recognition with high throughput,"In this paper, we propose a method of human activity recognition with high throughput from raw accelerometer data applying a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN), and investigate various architectures and its combination to find the best parameter values. The “high throughput” refers to short time at a time of recognition. We investigated various parameters and architectures of the DRNN by using the training dataset of 432 trials with 6 activity classes from 7 people. The maximum recognition rate was 95.42% and 83.43% against the test data of 108 segmented trials each of which has single activity class and 18 multiple sequential trials, respectively. Here, the maximum recognition rates by traditional methods were 71.65% and 54.97% for each. In addition, the efficiency of the found parameters was evaluated using additional dataset. Further, as for throughput of the recognition per unit time, the constructed DRNN was requiring only 1.347 ms, while the best traditional method required 11.031 ms which includes 11.027 ms for feature calculation. These advantages are caused by the compact and small architecture of the constructed real time oriented DRNN."

FOXM1 promotes pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell expansion in pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular remodeling disease characterized by a persistent elevation of pulmonary artery pressure, leading to right heart failure and premature death. Exaggerated proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is a key component of vascular remodeling. Despite major advances in the field, current therapies for PAH remain poorly effective in reversing the disease or significantly improving long-term survival. Because the transcription factor FOXM1 is necessary for PASMC proliferation during lung morphogenesis and its overexpression stimulates proliferation and evasion of apoptosis in cancer cells, we thus hypothesized that upregulation of FOXM1 in PAH-PASMCs promotes cell expansion and vascular remodeling. Our results showed that FOXM1 was markedly increased in distal pulmonary arteries and isolated PASMCs from PAH patients compared to controls as well as in two preclinical models. In vitro, we showed that miR-204 expression regulates FOXM1 levels and that inhibition of FOXM1 reduced cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis through diminished DNA repair mechanisms and decreased expression of the pro-remodeling factor survivin. Accordingly, inhibition of FOXM1 with thiostrepton significantly improved established PAH in two rat models. Thus, we show for the first time that FOXM1 is implicated in PAH development and represents a new promising target."
Magnetic resonance elastography can monitor changes in medullary stiffness in response to treatment in the swine ischemic kidney,Low-energy shockwave (SW) therapy attenuates damage in the stenotic kidney (STK) caused by atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS). We hypothesized that magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) would detect attenuation of fibrosis following SW in unilateral ARAS kidneys.
Equivariant CR minimal immersions from \(S^3\) into \(\mathbb CP^n\),"The equivariant CR minimal immersions from the round 3-sphere \(S^3\) into the complex projective space \(\mathbb CP^n\) have been classified by the third author explicitly (Li in J Lond Math Soc 68:223–240, 2003). In this paper, by employing the equivariant condition which implies that the induced metric is left-invariant and that all geometric properties of \(S^3=\mathrm{SU}(2)\) endowed with a left-invariant metric can be expressed in terms of the structure constants of the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {su}(2)\), we establish an extended classification theorem for equivariant CR minimal immersions from the 3-sphere \(S^3\) into \(\mathbb CP^n\) without the assumption of constant sectional curvatures."
Optimality conditions for nonsmooth multiobjective bilevel optimization problems,"This article is devoted to the study of a nonsmooth multiobjective bilevel optimization problem, which involves the vector-valued objective functions in both levels of the considered program. We first formulate a relaxation multiobjective formulation for the multiobjective bilevel problem and examine the relationships of solutions between them. We then establish Fritz John (FJ) and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions for the nonsmooth multiobjective bilevel optimization problem via its relaxation. This is done by studying a related multiobjective optimization problem with operator constraints."
Expanding the Menu of HIV Prevention Options: A Qualitative Study of Experiences with Long-Acting Injectable Cabotegravir as PrEP in the Context of a Phase II Trial in the United States,"Adherence challenges with oral pre-exposure prophylaxis have stimulated interest in alternate modes of administration including long-acting injections. We conducted 30 in-depth interviews with 26 male trial participants and 4 clinical providers in a Phase IIa study (ÉCLAIR) evaluating the use of long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) injections in New York and San Francisco. Interviews exploring attitudes and experiences with CAB-LA were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Despite a high frequency of some level of side effects, almost all participants reported being interested in continuing with CAB-LA, versus a daily oral, due to its convenience and the perceived advantage of not worrying about adhering to pills. Providers reinforced the importance of CAB-LA as a prevention option and the need for guidelines to assist patient decision-making. Further research is needed on the acceptability of CAB-LA among men and women at higher risk for HIV in different settings."
Quinolone susceptibility and genetic characterization of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolated from pet turtles,"Turtle-borne Salmonella enterica owns significance as a leading cause in human salmonellosis. The current study aimed to determine the quinolone susceptibility and the genetic characteristics of 21 strains of S. enterica subsp. enterica isolated from pet turtles. Susceptibility of four antimicrobials including nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin was examined in disk diffusion and MIC tests where the majority of the isolates were susceptible to all tested quinolones. In genetic characterization, none of the isolates were positive for qnr or aac(6’)-Ib genes and no any target site mutations could be detected in gyrA, gyrB, and parC quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR). In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree derived using gyrA gene sequences exhibited two distinct clads comprising; first, current study isolates, and second, quinolone-resistant isolates of human and animal origin. All results suggest that studied strains of S. enterica subsp. enterica isolated from pet turtles are susceptible to quinolones and genetically more conserved with regards to gyrA gene region."
Blood flow-improving activity of methyl jasmonate-treated adventitious roots of mountain ginseng,"Ginsenosides from Panax ginseng are well known for their diverse pharmacological effects including antithrombotic activity. Since adventitious roots of mountain ginseng (ARMG) also contain various ginsenosides, blood flow-improving effects of the dried powder and extract of ARMG were investigated. Rats were orally administered with dried powder (PARMG) or ethanol extract (EARMG) of ARMG (125, 250 or 500 mg/kg) or aspirin (30 mg/kg, a reference control) for 3 weeks. Forty min after the final administration, carotid arterial thrombosis was induced by applying a 70% FeCl3-soaked filter paper outside the arterial wall for 5 min, and the blood flow was monitored with a laser Doppler probe. Both PARMG and EARMG delayed the FeCl3-induced arterial occlusion in a dose-dependent manner, doubling the occlusion time at high doses. In mechanism studies, a high concentration of EARMG inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen in vitro. In addition, EARMG improved the blood lipid profiles, decreasing triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Although additional action mechanisms remain to be clarified, it is suggested that ARMG containing high amount of ginsenosides such as Rg3 improves blood flow not only by inhibiting oxidative thrombosis, but also by modifying blood lipid profiles."
Comparison of commonly used ICR stocks and the characterization of Korl:ICR,"Mouse is a commonly used animal in life science studies and is classified as outbred if genetically diverse and inbred if genetically homogeneous. Outbred mouse stocks, are used in toxicology, oncology, infection and pharmacology research. The National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS; former the Korea National Institute of Health) have bred ICR mice for more than 50 years. We investigated to provide users with information and promote accountability to the Korl:ICR. To secure the indigenous data, biological characteristics of Korl:ICR were identified by comparing with other ICR stocks. This domestic ICR stock was denominated as ‘Korl:ICR’. Phylogenetic analysis using SNPs indicated that the population stratification of the Korl:ICR was allocated different area with other ICR. In addition, we measured litter size, body weight, body length, various organ weight, hematology and clinical blood chemistry of the Korl:ICR compared to other ICR. Otherwise, there are no significant differences among the biological phenotypes of Korl:ICR and other ICR. These results suggest that as a genetically indigenous source colony, the Korl:ICR is seperated (or independent) stock with other ICR. Also, we confirmed that there is no difference among the Korl:ICR and other ICR on biological phenotypes. Therefore, the Korl:ICR source colony might be a new stock in distinction from other ICR, it is a good milestone in securing ownership of the national laboratory animal resource. The NIFDS expects that the Korl:ICR mice will be useful animal resource for our domestic researchers."
Dendropanax morbifera Léveille extract ameliorates d-galactose-induced memory deficits by decreasing inflammatory responses in the hippocampus,"In the present study, we examined the effects of Dendropanax morbifera Léveille leaf extract (DML) on dgalactose-induced morphological changes in microglia and cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the hippocampus. Administration of DML to d-galactose-treated mice significantly improved d-galactose-induced reduction in escape latency, swimming speed, and spatial preference for the target quadrant. In addition, administration of DML to d-galactose-treated mice significantly ameliorated the microglial activation and increases of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in the hippocampus. Administration of d-galactose significantly reduced IL-4 levels in the hippocampus, while administration of DML to d-galactose-treated mice significantly increased IL-4 level. However, we did not observe any significant changes in IL-10 levels in hippocampal homogenates. These results suggest that DML reduces d-galactose-induced mouse senescence by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4."
Super pregnancy in a BALB/c mouse superovulated with PMSG,"This paper reports a case of super pregnancy in a BALB/c mouse pregnant with 30 pups following induction of superovulation using a PMSG-hCG protocol. Superovulation was induced in 10 mice by injecting 5 IU PMSG followed by 5 IU hCG 48 hours later. Immediately after injection of hCG, animals were placed with males at a ratio of 1 to 1 for 24 hours. On day 14 after mating, animals were killed by cervical dislocation and the uterus was examined for pregnancy and the number of fetuses. The mean (±SEM) number of fetuses observed in ten mice was 5.4±3.18 with an unexpectedly super pregnant mouse bearing 30 fetuses on day 14 of pregnancy."
Comparison of the response using ICR mice derived from three different sources to multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus,"This study was conducted to compare the multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced diabetic patterns of Korl:ICR, A:ICR, and B:ICR mice obtained from three different sources. Six-week-old male ICR mice were obtained from three difference sources. Korl:ICR mice were kindly provided by the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS). The other two groups of ICR mice were purchased from different vendors located in the United States (A:ICR) and Japan (B:ICR). All ICR mice that received MLDS exhibited overt diabetic symptoms throughout the study, and the incidence and development of diabetes mellitus were similar among the three ICR groups. The diabetic mice exhibited hyperglycemia, loss of body weight gain, decreased plasma insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, decreased number of insulin-positive cells, and decreased size of β-cells in the pancreas. The diabetes symptoms increased as the blood glucose level increased in the three ICR groups. In particular, the level of blood glucose in the STZ-treated group was higher in Korl:ICR and A:ICR mice than in B:ICR mice. The plasma insulin levels, glucose tolerance, blood chemistry, and morphological appearance of the pancreas were very similar in the ICR groups obtained from the three different sources. In conclusion, our results suggest that Korl:ICR, A:ICR, and B:ICR mice from different sources had similar overall responses to multiple low-dose STZ to induce diabetes mellitus."
Reproductive performance of genetically engineered mice housed in different housing systems,"The genetically engineered mice require special husbandry care and are mainly housed in Individually Ventilated Cage (IVC) systems and Static Micro Isolator Cages (SMIC) to minimize the risk for spreading undesirable microorganisms. However, the static micro isolation cage housing like SMIC are being replaced with IVC systems in many facilities due to a number of benefits like a higher density housing in limited space, better protection from biohazards and allergens and decreased work load due to decreased frequency of cage changing required in this system. The purpose of this study was to examine the reproductive performance of genetically engineered mice housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) and Static Micro Isolator Cages (SMIC). When the B6C3-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/Mmjax transgenic mice were housed in these two housing systems, the number of litters per dam, number of pups born per dam and number of pups weaned per dam were found to be slightly higher in the IVC as compared to the SMIC but the difference was not significant (P<0.05). In case of Growth Associated Protein 43 (GAP-43) knockout mice, the number of litters born per dam and the number of pups born per dam were marginally higher in the IVC as compared to those housed in SMIC but the difference was not significant (P<0.05). Only the number of pups weaned per dam were found to be significantly higher as compared to those housed in the SMIC system at P<0.05."
Hyperglycemia decreases preoxiredoxin-2 expression in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model,"Diabetes is a major risk factor for stroke and is also associated with worsened outcomes following a stroke. Peroxiredoxin-2 exerts potent neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. In the present study, we identified altered peroxiredoxin-2 expression in an ischemic stroke model under hyperglycemic conditions. Adult male rats were administrated streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection to induce diabetes. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced surgically 4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment and cerebral cortex tissues were isolated 24 hours after MCAO. Peroxiredoxin-2 expression was evaluated in the cerebral cortex of MCAO-operated animals using a proteomics approach, and was found to be decreased. In addition, the reduction in peroxiredoxin-2 levels was more severe in cerebral ischemia with diabetes compared to animals without diabetes. Reverse-transcriptase PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed the significantly reduced peroxiredoxin-2 expression in MCAO-operated animals under hyperglycemic conditions. It is an accepted fact that peroxiredoxin-2 has antioxidative activity against ischemic injury. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that a more severe reduction in peroxiredoxin-2 under hyperglycemic conditions leads to worsened brain damage during cerebral ischemia with diabetes."
Antimicrobial property of lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) oil against pathogenic bacteria isolated from pet turtles,"The usage of essential oils as antimicrobial agents is gaining attention. Besides, pet turtles were known to harbor a range of pathogenic bacteria while the turtle keeping is a growing trend worldwide.The current study examined the antimicrobial activity of lemon grass oil (LGO) against seven species of Gram negative bacteria namely; Aeromonas hydrophila, A. caviae, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella enterica, Edwardsiella tarda, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from three popular species of pet turtles. Along with the results of disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC) tests, LGO was detected as effective against 6 species of bacteria excluding P. aeruginosa. MIC of LGO for the strains except P. aeruginosa ranged from 0.016 to 0.5% (V/V). The lowest MIC recorded in the E. tarda strain followed by A. hydrophilla, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, and S. enterica. Interestingly, all the bacterial species except E. tarda were showing high multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) index values ranging from 0.36 to 0.91 upon the 11 antibiotics tested although they were sensitive to LGO."
Artemisia argyi attenuates airway inflammation in lipopolysaccharide induced acute lung injury model,"Artemisia argyi is used as a health supplement, tea, and food source in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Artemisia argyi (AA) and its active compound, dehydromatricarin A (DA), on the attenuation of airway inflammation in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The C57BL/6 mice were administered AA (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) and DA (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) by oral gavage from day 0 to 7 days and LPS treated by intranasal instillation 48 hours before the sacrifice. The treatment of AA and DA markedly decreased inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) compared with that in ALI-induced mice, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in BALF. Furthermore, the administration of AA and DA clearly decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation in comparison with that in the ALI-induced mice. The histological examination of the lung tissue revealed that the administration of AA and DA suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration into the peribronchial and alveolar lesions induced by LPS instillation. Collectively, our results indicated that AA and DA effectively decreased the airway inflammatory response induced by LPS instillation. Therefore, AA and DA may offer a potential therapy for airway inflammatory disease."
"Age-dependent differences in myelin basic protein expression in the hippocampus of young, adult and aged gerbils","Myelin degeneration is one of the characteristics of aging and degenerative diseases. This study investigated age-related alterations in expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampal subregions (dentate gyrus, CA2/3 and CA1 areas) of gerbils of various ages; young (1 month), adult (6 months) and aged (24 months), using western blot and immunohistochemistry. Western blot results showed tendencies of age-related reductions of MBP levels. MBP immunoreactivity was significantly decreased with age in synaptic sites of trisynaptic loops, perforant paths, mossy fibers, and Schaffer collaterals. In particular, MBP immunoreactive fibers in the dentate molecular cell layer (perforant path) was significantly reduced in adult and aged subjects. In addition, MBP immunoreactive mossy fibers in the dentate polymorphic layer and in the CA3 striatum radiatum was significantly decreased in the aged group. Furthermore, we observed similar age-related alterations in the CA1 stratum radiatum (Schaffer collaterals). However, the density of MBP immunoreactive fibers in the dentate granular cell layer and CA stratum pyramidale was decreased with aging. These findings indicate that expression of MBP is age-dependent and tissue specific according to hippocampal layers."
Screening and detection of delirium in older ED patients: performance of the modified Confusion Assessment Method for the Emergency Department (mCAM-ED). A two-step tool,"Delirium is frequent in older Emergency Department (ED) patients, but detection rates for delirium in the ED are low. To aid in identifying delirium, we developed and implemented a two-step systematic delirium screening and assessment tool in our ED: the modified Confusion Assessment Method for the Emergency Department (mCAM-ED). Components of the mCAM-ED include: (1) screening for inattention, the main feature of delirium, which was performed with the Months Backwards Test (MBT); (2) delirium assessment based on a structured interview with questions from the Mental Status Questionnaire by Kahn et al. and the Comprehension Test by Hart et al. The aims of our study are (1) to investigate the performance criteria of the mCAM-ED tool in a consecutive sample of older ED patients, (2) to evaluate the performance of the mCAM-ED in patients with and without dementia and (3) to test whether this tool is efficient in keeping evaluation time to a minimum and reducing screening and assessment burden on the patient. For this prospective validation study, we recruited a consecutive sample of ED patients aged 65 and older during an 11-day period in November 2015. Trained nurses assessed patients with the mCAM-ED. Results were compared to the reference standard [i.e. the geriatricians’ delirium diagnosis based on the criteria of the Text Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]. Performance criteria were computed. We included 286 consecutive ED patients aged 65 and older. The median age was 80.02 (Q1 = 72.15; Q3 = 86.76), 58.7% of included patients were female, 14.3% had dementia. We found a delirium prevalence of 7.0%. In patients with dementia, specificity and positive likelihood ratio were lower. When compared to the reference standard, delirium assessment with the mCAM-ED has a 0.98 specificity and a 39.9 positive likelihood ratio. In 80.0% of all cases, the first step of the mCAM-ED, i.e. screening for inattention with the MBT, took less than 30 s. On average, the complete mCAM-ED assessment required 3.2 (SD 2.0), 5.6 (SD 3.2), and 6.2 (SD 2.3) minutes in cognitively unimpaired patients, patients with dementia and patients with dementia or delirium, respectively. The mCAM-ED is able to efficiently rule out delirium as well as confirm the diagnosis of delirium in elderly patients with and without dementia and applies minimal screening and assessment burden on the patient."
Noise-resilient compressed domain video watermarking system for in-car camera security,"In-car camera system emerges as a very useful technology for automobile drivers, as it can provide proper evidence to insurance companies and to police investigators in case of car accidents. Dashcam, being one of the car video storage devices, stores the data in the SD card which is overwritten and can be tampered very easily. Thus, it is important to develop an in-car security system, where data can be stored in the server and can provide privacy to the user. In this paper, we have proposed a noise-resilient compressed domain video watermarking system for in-car security to document the vehicle history which can be a proof for any mischief. We have used Independent Pass Coding (INPAC) compression technique for designing the system. Here, data generated by the system is stored in the server database which is accessible to the authentic registered user and administrator in case of any claim. This system ensures copyright, proprietorship, authentication and security against third party intrusion. The proposed system is implemented in off-line mode to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, and in online mode to verify the system. Graphical user interface is designed for the end user access, to make it user friendly."
"Assessment of trace metals contamination in stream sediments and soils in Abuja leather mining, southwestern Nigeria","This study is aimed at determining the level of environmental degradation as well as the concentration of trace elements in soil and stream sediments in order to evaluate the environmental impact of the mining operation. Twenty-five (25) soils and ten (10) stream sediment samples were collected from the study area. The physicochemical parameters were determined using appropriate instrumentation with the aid of a digital pH meter (Milwaukee meter) to measure the pH and electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, moisture content and loss on ignition of the soil and stream sediment samples. The pH of the soil sample ranged from (6.10 to 7.19); Electrical conductivity ranged from (21.3 to 279.4 µS/cm), moisture content varied from (0.60% to 7.20%), and the LOI ranged from (2.03% to 18.62%). The results of the analysis showed that the concentrations of the trace elements in the soils and stream sediment samples were slightly higher than the background values. Plots of the trace elements in stream sediment samples show moderate, consistent decrease downstream except at points where there was mine water discharge into the main river. The pollution levels of heavy metals were examined in stream sediment and soil samples using different assessable indices, such as the enrichment factor, which showed significant-moderate enrichment for Cr, Th, Nb, Zn, Pb, Y and Zr and the geo-accumulation index, which showed practically moderate contamination with Cr, Ni and Sr based on regional background reference values. Geo-accumulation index and contamination index for soils and stream sediment revealed uncontaminated to moderate contamination. Likewise, elements with moderate contamination were Cr, Ni and Sr. The Pearson correlation showed that there were significant positive associations among selected metals in soil and stream sediment samples."
"Cinnamic Acid and Fish Flour Affect Wheat Phenolic Acids and Flavonoid Compounds, Lipid Peroxidation, Proline Levels Under Salt Stress","To elucidate the physiological mechanism of salt stress mitigated by cinnamic acid (CA) and fish flour (FF) pretreatment, wheat was pretreated with 20, 50 and 100 ppm CA and 1 g/10 mL FF for 2 d and was then cultivated. We investigated whether exogenous CA + FF could protect wheat from salt stress and examined whether the protective effect was associated with the regulation of seed vigor, antioxidant defense systems, phenolic biosynthesis and lipid peroxidation. At 2 days exogenous CA did not influence seed vigor. Salt stress increased the phenolic biosynthesis, but the CA + FF-combined pretreatment enhanced the phenolic biosynthesis even more under salt stress and decreased lipid peroxidation to some extent, enhancing the tolerance of wheat to salt stress."
Spider assemblages in floodplain forests along an urbanization gradient,"Urban areas have been growing radically worldwide, causing considerable changes in biodiversity of natural habitats. In floodplain forests, we studied the effects of urbanization on ground-dwelling spider assemblages along a rural-suburban—urban gradient in Hungary. We tested three traditional hypotheses (intermediate disturbance hypothesis, habitat specialist hypothesis and hygrophilous species hypothesis) and two novel expectations (shade-preferring species hypothesis, and disturbance sensitive species hypothesis) on spiders. We found that the total number of species was higher in the suburban habitat than in rural and urban ones, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. We found a decrease in the species richness of forest specialist and shade-preferring species along the urbanization gradient. We found that the number of hygrophilous and disturbance sensitive species was the lowest in the urban habitat. The spider assemblages of the rural and suburban habitats were clearly separated from the assemblages of urban habitats. Based on our findings we emphasize that low and moderate intensity of forest management contributes to the preservation of the local species richness in floodplain forests."
Simultaneous Quantification of Two Phenolic Biomarkers by a Validated High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatographic Method in Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Active Ethyl Acetate Fraction of Allium cepa L. (Peel),"In this study, we have developed a validated high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method for the simultaneous quantification of two phenolic biomarkers, protocatechuic acid (compound 1) and quercetin 4′-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (compound 2) in antimicrobial and antioxidant active A. cepa ethyl acetate extract (ACEAE). The quantitative analysis was carried out on normal-phase HPTLC (glass-backed silica gel 60 F254) plates with solvents toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid in the ratio of 3:6:1, v/v (as the mobile phase). Well-resolved, compact, and intense peaks of compound 1 (RF = 0.56 ± 0.001) and compound 2 (RF = 0.05 ± 0.001) were found at λmax = 275 nm. The linear regression equation / r2 for compound 1 (Y = 8.89X + 250.71 / 0.994) and compound 2 (Y = 6.64 X + 209.34 / 0.998) in the concentration range of 100–700 ng spot-1 indicated good linear relationship. The low values of percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) for intra-day / inter-day precision of compound 1 (1.14–1.26 / 1.08–1.23) and compound 2 (0.97–1.18 / 0.93–1.16) suggested that the method is precise. The (%) recoveries for compound 1 / compound 2 were found as 98.07–99.55 / 98.20– 99.89 which confrms the good accuracy of the proposed method. The quantities (%w/w) of compound 1 / compound 2 in ACEAE were found as 18.84% / 13.64% of the dried weight of the extract. In vitro 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed the promising free radical scavenging activity of ACEAE (69.00 ± 2.99%) and compound 2 (63.86 ± 2.02%) which were comparable to ascorbic acid tested at 400 µg mL-1. ACEAE was found to be highly active against all tested bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Candida albicans was found to be susceptible to both compound 2 and ACEAE. The presence of compound 2 in high quantity in the ethyl acetate fractions of A. cepa peel (ACEAE) validated its antimicrobial and antioxidant property. The above developed HPTLC method can be further employed in the analysis of these markers in marketed formulations and in the quality control of herbal drugs."
Thin-Layer Chromatographic Separation and a Validated High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography Method for the Quantification of Stigmasterol in 48 Different Extracts of Lasiurus scindicus Henrard (Poaceae),"The present study is the first attempt on the phytochemical analysis of Lasiurus scindicus Henrard, a desert-specific plant, through high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). This technique has been developed and validated for the quantification of stigmasterol from 48 extracts, i.e., four d i ferent plant part s w ith six diferent solvents (butanol, chloroform, ethanol, hexane, meth-anol, and petroleum ether) in both hot and cold macerations. This method gave the best resolution bands with toluene—methanol—for-mic acid (9:1:0.3, v/v) for 25 min as the mobile phase at retention factor (RF) of 0.27 for stigmasterol. The method was validated using the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines in terms of precision, repeatability, and accuracy. The linearity range for stigmasterol was found to be 2–12 µg spot-1. Both hot and cold extractions with six diferent solvents were compared. The highest concentration of stigmasterol was found in the leaves of L. scindicus in cold hexane extract (52.07 mg g-1), stem and infores-cence in cold ethanol extract (93.81 and 59.34 mg g-1, respectively), and root in cold chloroform extracts (5.82 mg g-1). It follows in the decreasing order of stem ˃ leaves ˃ inforescence ˃ roots. The recovery value was 99.33% which shows excellent accuracy of the method. From the obtained results, it is concluded that cold extractions are best for the plant taken under investigation. HPTLC was found to be a simple, precise, accurate, and convenient method for the rapid screening of steroids in L. scindicus."
Quantification of Glycosylceramides in Plants by Automated Multiple Development—High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography,"Glycosylceramides (GlyCers) are precursors of ceramides (Cers) that are major components of the outer layer of human skin, the stratum corneum. A Cer deficiency is associated with skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis and can be treated with Cer-containing semisolid formulations. Plants may serve as alternative sources for expensive semisynthetic Cer production. Since the GlyCer contents of plants vary widely, there is a need to develop a rapid, simple, selective, and precise method for GlyCer quanti-fcation in plants. In the present study, an efective and validated automated multiple development—high-performance thin-layer chromatography (AMD—HPTLC) method has been developed for GlyCer quantification in 9 d iferent plant materials. An 18 -step gradient elution program (n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, meth-anol) led to a clear separation of bands from complex matrices and allowed densitometric analysis for quantification purposes. Apple pomace and wheat germs yielded 26.8 and 39.5 mg of GlyCer per 100 g plant material, respectively, while the yields of cofee grounds were below the limit of quantification. The GlyCer contents of the seeds of six Fabaceae species, namely, Albizia grandibracteata, Albi-zia gummifera, Albizia lebbeck, Albizia schimperiana, Acacia etba-ica, and Robinia pseudoacacia, ranged from 9.4 to 23.1 mg per 100 g plant material. GlyCers were separated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and identified by offline high-performance liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (HPLC—MS). Intact GlyCers were detected in the Fabaceae species for the first time. A simple AMD—HPTLC screening and quantification technique for GlyCers was developed, which may serve as a tool in searching plant GlyCers for a possible “phyto”-Cer production."
Simultaneous Quantification of Six Phenolic Compounds in Various Parts of Moringa oleifera Lam. Using High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography,"Fresh pods of Moringa oleifera with nutraceutical importance are widely consumed in food commodities as vegetables. It is nutritious and it also has several biological activities. In the present study, a simple, rapid, cost-efective, and sensitive high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was applied for the simultaneous determination of six phenolic compounds, viz., gallic (phenolic acid), p-coumaric, cafeic acid (hydroxycinnamic acid), chlorogenic acid (cinnamic acid derivative), quercetin and kaempferol (flavonols) in flowers, pods, leaves, twigs, and seeds of M. oleifera. Simultaneous separation and quantification of compounds were achieved on HPTLC pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 aluminum plates using the mobile phase toluene—ethyl acetate—formic acid (14:10:1). Densitometric determination was carried out at λmax 282 nm. The calibration curves were linear, ranged between 0.984 and 0.998; the limit of detection and quantification ranged between 110.8 ng mL-1 and 142.3 ng mL-1, and 301.6 ng µL-1 and 410.8 ng µL-1; and recovery ranged between 96.2% and 97.9%. The validated method was successively used to analyze the above compounds in the plant parts of M. oleifera. The amount of the total phenolic content and specifc phenolic compounds ranged from 4.86 mg g-1 (gallic acid equivalent [GAE]) to 14.79 mg g-1 (GAE) and 0.007% quercetin (fower and fower with pods) to 0.099% gallic acid (pods of 15 days). This study reveals that the presence of specific phenolic compounds in M. oleifera shall be a good source for the isolation of the above-mentioned compounds for industrial use."
"Nucleolar organizer regions, 18S and 5S rDNA clusters in the chromosomes of Piabina argentea (Characiformes: Characidae)","The Piabina genus was allocated in Stervadiinae subfamily after staying for years as an uncertain group in Characidae. Few cytogenetic studies are described in the literature for Piabina argentea, thus new analyzes in other populations are important to understanding of the chromosomal dynamics of them. The aim of this paper was to analyze the chromosomes of P. argentea from Corumbataí River basin focusing mainly the chromosomal locations of 18S rDNA and 5S rDNA clusters. The diploid chromosome number was 2n = 52 for P. argentea, which were classified as 6 metacentrics (m), 8 submetacentrics (sm), 24 subtelocentrics (st) and 14 acrocentrics (a), and FN (fundamental number) value 90 in both sexes. Silver nitrate impregnation located the nucleolus organizer regions (Ag-NORs) on the short (p) arm of pair 16, however, an intra-individual variation of Ag-NORs sites was observed in two individuals. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed six 18S rDNA sites (pairs 8, 10 and 16) and four 5S rDNA sites in terminal positions of the short arm of pairs 5 and 22 (one submetacentric and one acrocentric) in P. argentea. The results indicate that, despite the conserved diploid number, this group of fish presents a wide variability of the 18S and 5S rDNA sites."
"Occurrence of the rare root aphid parasitoid, Aclitus obscuripennis (Hymeoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) in Iran","The sampling surveys were conducted in the northern Iran, using several Malaise traps, during 2010–2011. A single specimen of a rare root aphid parasitoid, Aclitus obscuripennis Förster, 1862 (Hym.: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) was identified among the collected specimens. This is the first record of the genus Aclitus in Iran and western Asian area. Aclitus obscuripennis is re-described and illustrated and its occurrence in Iran is discussed. Additional specimens from central Europe were examined and compared. Our findings introduced a new tritrophic ecological system to be further investigated in upcoming studies"
Rhynchotalona falcata (Crustacea: Anomopoda: Chydoridae): First recording in Slovakia with notes on its distribution and biology,"Rhynchotalona falcata (G.O. Sars, 1861) was found in the plankton of a gravel pit located in the lowlands of Slovakia. This is the first record of this taxon for Slovakia, although it is widely distributed in Western Europe. We do not know to date, whether it is a rare, native species of Slovakian fauna, or accidentally introduced one from north-west regions of Europe. Some notes on its biology and distribution in Europe are provided."
"Plant ecophysiological responses to drought, nocturnal warming and variable climate in the Pannonian sand forest-steppe: results of a six-year climate manipulation experiment","The impacts of year-round nocturnal warming or late spring rain exclusion on three plant functional types were studied in a plot-scale climate simulation experiment in a semiarid sand forest-steppe of Central Hungary. Ecophysiological traits were followed through six years for the C3 bunch grass Festuca vaginata, the spreading C4 grass Cynodon dactylon and shrub-sized root suckers of Populus alba. In general, experimental treatments had slighter effects than weather fluctuations yielding extremities did. Populus alba responded to nocturnal warming with developing slenderer leaves. Rain exclusion reduced leaf physiological activity or growth, but only during or just after the treatment, and in certain years. When assessing treatment and background climatic variation effects together, in spring, leaf area growth was consistently stimulated by increasing temperature, but decreased with longer rainless periods for P. alba and F. vaginata. Physiological responses in spring indicated low temperature limitation for C. dactylon, and both low and high temperature control for P. alba. Longer summer droughts reduced leaf gas exchange, particularly for F. vaginata with substantial drop in photochemical activity and chlorophyll content. These results suggest that shallow rooted C3 bunch grasses can be the most susceptible to climatic variation, thus their abundance is expected to decline in the Pannonian forest-steppe. In contrast, plants having deeper roots and clonal integration will probably be less affected by the projected warming and drying climate. C4 photosynthesis or southern geographical distribution may also be beneficial, thus, the abundance of such species is expected to diminish less or even increase."
The three-dimensional fine structure of the human heart: a scanning electron microscopic atlas for research and education,"Knowledge about the three-dimensional fine structure of human heart, as a crucial vital organ of the body, is not only fascinating from the scientific or educational points of view, but has a very important clinical impact. Therefore, we decided to create a three-dimensional atlas of fine structure of the human heart. Tissue samples from ten human hearts were rinsed in phosphate-buffer solution, fixed by glutaraldehyde buffered solution, and post-fixed in osmium tetroxide solution. A gentle dehydration with ethanol in different concentration and drying at the critical point of CO2 were applied as next procedures. Non-conductive specimens were galvanized with thin gold layer and observed in scanning electron microscope. In this study, we present the three-dimensional ultrastructural architecture of the human heart from patients after myocardial infarction, end-stage failing heart as well as without apparent cardiac abnormalities at the time of autopsy. The results are presented as a histological atlas. Its images illustratively describe the fine structure of endocardium including the morphology of Purkyně (Purkinje) fibres, spatial arrangements of cardiac muscle cells inside myocardium or the arrangements of adipose tissue of epicardium. We present also figures of the ultrastructure of papillary muscles, intercalated discs as well as the connective tissue scars after myocardial infarction. The scanning electron microscopy could be a reliable technique to perform a more complete morphological data and to improve our knowledge of some pathological changes of tissues and cells, not always detected by conventional morphological examinations."
"The characterization of a novel bacterial strain capable of microcystin degradation from the Jeziorsko reservoir, Poland: a preliminary study","The paper describes the isolation and characterization of a novel pelagic bacterial strain capable of hepatotoxic microcystin (MC) degradation. From a total of 24 bacterial strains isolated from water samples collected during the cyanobacteria blooming period in Jeziorsko reservoir, Poland, only the strain JEZ-8L was found to completely degrade microcystin-LR (MC-LR). The strain JEZ-8L was found to include the full mlrABCD gene cluster associated with the biological degradation of MC. To our knowledge, the strain JEZ-8L may represent the first report of an isolated bacterium to contain the full mlrABCD gene cluster in an aquatic ecosystem from central Europe. The nucleotide sequence analysis of each mlr gene and their translated amino acid sequences revealed a close similarity to other MC-degrading bacteria belonging to the Sphingomonadaceae family. Phylogenetic analysis using the bacterial gene marker 16S rRNA revealed 99% sequence similarity with nine strains from the Sphingosinicella genus. The nucleotide sequence similarity between the strain JEZ-8L and Sphingosinicella microcystinivorans Y2 was probably the most representative, since the strain Y2 is known to be a MC-degrading bacterium with confirmed detection from the full mlrABCD gene cluster. It is important to mention that our findings represent a preliminary study on the microbiota involved in MC degradation in water bodies from central Poland. The MC-degrading activity of the strain JEZ-8L could be promising for further research towards the elaboration of biotechnological solutions to reduce the harmful effects of MCs in water."
Inhibitory Effects of Four Neonicotinoid Active Ingredients on Acetylcholine Esterase Activity,"There is a great concern about the decline of pollinators, and neonicotinoids emerging bee disorders are assumed to play a significant role. Since changes in learning ability has been observed in honey bees exposed to some acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors, we therefore, tested in vitro the effect of four neonicotinoids on purified eel AChE. AChE activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, and calculated IC50 values for thiamethoxam (IC50 = 414 μM) and clothianidin (IC50 = 160 μM) were found to be much higher compared to acetamiprid (IC50 = 75.2 μM) and thiacloprid (IC50 = 87.8 μM). The Lineweaver–Burk reciprocal plots for acetamiprid shows unchanged Vmax and increased Km values with inhibitor concentrations, while analysis of Michaelis–Menten plots shows predominantly competitive mechanism. The inhibition constant value (Ki = 24.3 μM) indicates strong binding of the acetamiprid complex to AChE. Finally, the four tested neonicotinoids are not a uniform group regarding their blocking ability. Our results suggest a previously not established, direct AChE blocking mechanism of neonicotinoids tested, thus the neuronal AChE enzyme is likely among the direct targets of the neonicotinoid insecticides. We conclude, that these AChE inhibitory effects may also contribute to toxic effects on the whole exposed animal."
Hydrogen Peroxide Prolongs Mitotic Arrest in a Dose Dependent Manner and Independently of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint Activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Oxidative stress and chromosome missegregation are important factors that are linked to aneuploidy. A major reason for chromosome missegragation is the inappropriate activity of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a conserved surveillance mechanism that monitors the state of kinetochore-microtubule attachments to ensure equal chromosome segregation in mitosis. SAC-activation induces a prolonged mitotic arrest. Mitosis is considered the most vulnerable cell cycle phase to several external signals, therefore increasing the time cells spent in this phase via mitotic arrest induction by SAC-activating agents is favorable for cancer therapy. Cancer cells also display elevated oxidative stress due to abnormally high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the effect of increased oxidative stress on the duration of mitotic arrest remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of H2O2-induced oxidative stress on the mitotic arrest induced by a SAC-activating agent (nocodazole) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data suggest that oxidative stress prolongs SAC-activation induced mitotic arrest in a dose dependent manner. We, in addition, investigated the effect of H2O2 treatment on the mitotic arrest induced independently of SAC-activation by using a conditional mutant (cdc23) and showed that the effect of H2O2-induced oxidative stress on mitotic arrest is independent of the SAC activity."
Anterolateral Thigh Flap Combined with Reconstruction Plate Versus Double Free Flaps for Composite Mandibular Reconstruction: A Propensity Score-Matched Study,"This study was designed to examine the comparative effectiveness of oromandibular defect reconstruction via anterolateral thigh flap and bridging plate (ALT only) versus simultaneous soft tissue and vascularized bone flap (DFF), with regards to long-term plate exposure and complications."
A Macromarketing View of Sustainable Development in Vietnam,"The authors apply methods and perspectives from several disciplines to explore the effects of Vietnam's economic development on various ecosystems, to offer a macromarketing view of sustainable development in Vietnam. An adapted version of the Sustainable Society Index was used to assess Vietnam's sustainability, how Vietnam's measures compare to other countries, with implications for future sustainable-development. Among several findings, Vietnam earns favorable sustainability ratings in absolute terms for water resources, healthy living, energy use, greenhouse gases, genuine savings, and employment. Ominously, Vietnam and some of its nearby neighbors post poor scores for energy savings and education. Going forward, energy savings, a well-educated population, and a coordinated marketing system will be required to ensure favorable sustainability measures. Drawing on macromarketing explorations of complex and interdependent systems, key factors are considered to redress unsustainable resource exploitation and degradation. Particular attention is given to the complexities and dilemmas inherent to waterways, such as the Mekong River Basin and Delta. The authors argue for multi-win goals, systemic understanding, stakeholder inclusion, and resolutions via cooperation and constructive engagement—including projects, products, services, and institutional leadership for best practices designed and administered to enhance sustainability and citizen/societal well-being."
Regulatory variants of FOXG1 in the context of its topological domain organisation,"FOXG1 syndrome is caused by FOXG1 intragenic point mutations, or by long-range position effects (LRPE) of intergenic structural variants. However, the size of the FOXG1 regulatory landscape is uncertain, because the associated topologically associating domain (TAD) in fibroblasts is split into two domains in embryonic stem cells (hESC). Indeed, it has been suggested that the pathogenetic mechanism of deletions that remove the stem-cell-specific TAD boundary may be enhancer adoption due to ectopic activity of enhancer(s) located in the distal hESC-TAD. Herein we map three de novo translocation breakpoints to the proximal regulatory domain of FOXG1. The classical FOXG1 syndrome in these and in other translocation patients, and in a patient with an intergenic deletion that removes the hESC-specific TAD boundary, do not support the hypothesised enhancer adoption as a main contributor to the FOXG1 syndrome. Also, virtual 4 C and HiC-interaction data suggest that the hESC-specific TAD boundary may not be critical for FOXG1 regulation in a majority of human cells and tissues, including brain tissues and a neuronal progenitor cell line. Our data support the importance of a critical regulatory region (SRO) proximal to the hESC-specific TAD boundary. We further narrow this critical region by a deletion distal to the hESC-specific boundary, associated with a milder clinical phenotype. The distance from FOXG1 to the SRO ( > 500 kb) highlight a limitation of ENCODE DNase hypersensitivity data for functional prediction of LRPE. Moreover, the SRO has little overlap with a cluster of frequently associating regions (FIREs) located in the proximal hESC-TAD."

Also, virtual 4 C and HiC-interaction data suggest that the hESC-specific TAD boundary may not be critical for FOXG1 regulation in a majority of human cells and tissues, including brain tissues and a neuronal progenitor cell line. Our data support the importance of a critical regulatory region (SRO) proximal to the hESC-specific TAD boundary. We further narrow this critical region by a deletion distal to the hESC-specific boundary, associated with a milder clinical phenotype. The distance from FOXG1 to the SRO ( > 500 kb) highlight a limitation of ENCODE DNase hypersensitivity data for functional prediction of LRPE. Moreover, the SRO has little overlap with a cluster of frequently associating regions (FIREs) located in the proximal hESC-TAD."
TOPSIS with similarity measure for MADM applied to network selection,"In this article, a new method is introduced to handle fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making problems. The method preserves fuzziness in the preference technique to avoid the drawbacks of defuzzification. The study modifies the technique of order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) for interval-valued fuzzy numbers. The traditional TOPSIS uses the relative degree of closeness to rank the alternatives. Instead, a similarity measure based on map distance is used for preference. The degree of similarity between each attribute of an alternative and the ideal solution is computed, and a similarity matrix is formed. Then, the total degree of similarity for all the attributes of an alternative is used for ranking. The alternative corresponding to the one norm of the similarity matrix is the best alternative. Thus, the comparison is done on a fuzzy basis to avoid the loss of information due to converting the elements of the weighted normalized decision matrix to crisp values by defuzzification. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the approach. A practical example in network selection to optimize vertical hand offs is solved where both user preferences and network parameters are treated as interval-valued fuzzy numbers."
Leaf periderm supports longevity and functionality of crown leaves in Agathis species (Araucariaceae),"Periderm of the leaves of two Agathis species was studied. Agathis leaves are long-lived and remain alive for more than 25 years. Periderm occurs regularly and can be initiated in the epidermis, mesophyll, phloem parenchyma of the leaf veins and in the ground tissue of the petiole. Periderm lies on the surface, is located in the mesophyll or splits it. Periderm structure is either typical, consisting of phellogen, multilayered phellem and phelloderm or disordered. Agathis leaves are able to form true wound periderm, which has been shown experimentally. We believe that at least some of the factors inducing periderm initiation are identical both in leaves and in stems. Mechanical tension in the tissues and cell deformation plays an essential role in the periderm initiation. Leaf tissues isolated due to the suberinization process may function as a storage site for the substances not involved in the plant metabolism or excluded from it. Periderm gives an opportunity to keep such substances away from functional tissues, which is important for evergreen plants with long-lived leaves."
Effects of progressive muscle relaxation training on sleep and quality of life in patients with pulmonary resection,"The inadequate quality and nature of sleep is a commonly reported problem among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of progressive muscle relaxation training program on sleep quality, sleep state, pain, and quality of life in patients who underwent pulmonary resection."
Duplication and gene expression patterns of β-catenin in Nile tilapia,"β-Catenin, a key transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt pathway, plays an important role in animal embryonic development and organogenesis. In our earlier study, we have reported that two types of β-catenin (β-catenin-1 and β-catenin-2) were ubiquitously expressed in almost all the tissues examined in tilapia. However, the immunolocalization of β-catenin in those tissues, especially in extra-gonadal tissues, remains unclear. In the present study, we further confirm that these two types of β-catenin gene exist only in teleosts and are derived from 3R (third round of genome duplication) by phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis conducted in this investigation reveals that two β-catenins exhibited similar expression patterns in seven adult tissues and four key developmental stages of XX and XY gonads. Finally, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect the cell localization of β-catenin. A positive signal of β-catenin was observed in various tissues of tilapia, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, eye, brain, and gonads. The results of our study indicate that tilapia β-catenin might be involved in the organ development and play some specific functions in biological processes; all these data will provide basic reference for understanding the molecular mechanism of β-catenin in regulating of teleost organogenesis."

"Parity, Timing and Level of Fertility: A Comparative Study on Mean Age at Childbearing in China, Japan and South Korea","Using fertility data from national surveys and population censuses for China, Japan and South Korea, this study analyzes the levels and trends of mean age at childbearing (MAC) in the three countries from 1990 to 2015. After using the decomposition technique to isolate the effects of parity composition and childbearing schedule in each of the three countries, the article presents a quantitative examination of the factors that underlie dynamic changes and cross-national differences of MACs. Results indicate that the MAC of China experienced a decrease between 1990 and 1995, followed by sustained growth afterwards. The increase of MAC in China has been driven by the postponement of childbearing and changes in parity composition, with the former playing a larger role. The mechanisms underlying the patterns since 2010 deserve special attention. Compared with Japan and South Korea, China has had relatively lower MAC during the last 25 years; the three countries demonstrate different patterns in terms of the roles of parity composition and birth timing. The accuracy of MAC in identifying the timing of period fertility and the policy implications of timing on upturning fertility level are discussed."
"Returned Migrants, Family Capital and Entrepreneurship in Rural China","This paper introduces an interaction item consisting of migration experience and family capital into a rural labor employment selection model. It analyzes how migration experience helps eliminate resource constraints in rural areas and facilitates the participation of rural workers in entrepreneurship. We find that the length of time migrants work in migrant inflow areas exerts a significantly positive influence on the non-agricultural employment of returned migrants. We also find that those returned migrants who have worked in the service industry prefer to work for local enterprises. Furthermore, returned migrant workers with business experience tend to start their own businesses upon returning home. Compared with non-migrants, returned migrants are more capable of utilizing their rural family capital in the entrepreneurial process. These findings suggest that both migration experience and family capital promote local employment and entrepreneurship in rural areas, despite the fact that they are subject to the imperfect rural market mechanism and lack adequate social support."
Population Migration and Brain Drain in Northeast China,"Migration has been the main driver during the last decade of population change in Northeast China, an area made up of three provinces, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning. A net out flow of population has resulted in the loss of younger laborers in the area. More than two million people migrate out of Northeast China, and the number is increasing. The flow direction is from north to south. Liaoning in the south is a province of net in-migration, and Jilin and Heilongjiang in the north are provinces of net out-migration. There are large differences in the education and age structure of inflow and outflow migrants; the out-flow areas are losing human capital. This study uses a Dynamic Monitoring Survey of Migrant Population to analyze population flows in Northeast China, and uses employment information for university graduates to analyze the problem of brain drain in this area."
Breeding biology of Chalk-browed Mockingbird Mimus saturninus in a natural savanna of central Brazil,"The Chalk-browed Mockingbird Mimus saturninus (Mimidae) is a common bird in savannas, grasslands, and farmlands, also occurring in urban areas. We studied its breeding biology in a Cerrado savanna inside a reserve at central Brazil, from 2003 to 2013. We monitored 74 nests, which were usually found in the more open phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado. The breeding season lasted from late August to late December. The nest is a cup built with twigs and generally placed on shrubs and small trees. Mean nest height above the ground was 1.3 ± 0.5 m (n = 73). Mean clutch size was of 2.9 ± 0.9 eggs (n = 63), ranging from one (possibly an incomplete clutch) to six eggs (possibly a communal nest). Incubation was asynchronous, the incubation period lasted 14.2 ± 0.9 days (n = 17 nests), and the nestling period lasted 14.1 ± 1.2 days (n = 21 nests). Nestling infestation by botfly larvae was common (60% of nests), but did not cause any nest loss. Its breeding season was similar to most birds of the Cerrado region, but its clutch size was larger. The Chalk-browed Mockingbird breeding biology in central Brazil is similar to that reported from the southern part of its distribution. The species is capable of multiple broods, has cooperative breeding and shows evidence of communal breeding, a rare behavior reported so far for Mimidae. The main difference between our study and those conducted with the Chalk-browed Mockingbird in Argentina, is the very low prevalence of brood parasites, demonstrating the importance of reserves to allow breeding with low brood parasitism rates."
"Twenty years later: an update to the birds of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Amazonas, Brazil","Although species lists from throughout Amazonia have become available, relatively complete inventories based on longterm work remain rare. Longitudinal comparisons at well-studied sites provide the best opportunities for describing communities and identifying changes in regional avifaunas. Within central Amazonia, no region has received as much consistent ornithological coverage as the terra firme forests north of Manaus, Brazil, at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Here we provide an updated list of the area, including notes on all species added between 1997 and 2017. We recorded 21 species new for the site, most of which (>75%) are birds that prefer várzea or second-growth forest. This brings the cumulative BDFFP list up to 409 species, the majority (66%) of which inhabit primary terra firme forest. Together, this confirms that the regional terra firme community had been well-characterized by the 1990s, and that species additions to the list over the last 20 years are consistent with a changing landscape as urbanization, agriculture, and second-growth spread from Manaus. The final product continues to represent the most complete avian inventory for a single site in all of lowland Amazonia."
Gum Dammar and poly(acrylamide)-based hydrogels and zirconium-based organic-inorganic hybrid materials for controlled drug delivery and their biodegradation studies,"The present research work was aimed at the use of pre-synthesized Gum Dammar and poly(AAm)-based polymeric networks (hydrogel) and zirconium-based Gd-cl-poly(AAm)-ZIO organo-inorganic hybrid networks (ion exchanger) for in situ release of metformin hydrochloride under different pH conditions such as 4.0, 7.0 and 9.2 at 37 °C. Further biodegradation studies of the samples were also done using soil burial and soil composting method. It has been observed from the release dynamics of the drug that the diffusion exponent ‘n’ under different pH conditions is between 0.1 and 0.7 in case of hydrogel and between 0.09 and 0.7 in case of organo-inorganic hybrid material. It can be inferred from the values of the ‘n’ that the release of drug in different pH conditions is pH responsive. Hence these materials can be exploited as drug delivery devices. The initial diffusion coefficient has a greater value than the later diffusion coefficient indicating a higher drug release rate during the early stage. Different stages of biodegradation were characterized using scanning electron microscopic studies."
A multi-institution phase II study of docetaxel and S-1 in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (DASH study),Trastuzumab when combined with fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin was proven to improve survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive gastric cancer (GC) in the ToGA study. The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel and S-1 have not yet been evaluated.
"Poloxamers, poloxamines and polymeric micelles: Definition, structure and therapeutic applications in cancer","Research for new therapies to treat diseases like cancer, it is one of the focus of Health Sciences. Nowadays, the available therapeutic strategies have in many cases limitations and undesired side effects, which shows a need to find new therapies with a higher efficacy. In this regard, over the past few years, poloxamers and poloxamines have been gaining more attention in the pharmaceutical field, mainly due to their advantages as potential nanosystems. Therefore, poloxamers and poloxamines are amphiphilic block of copolymers constituted by PEO units, poly(ethylene oxide), and PPO units, poly(propylene oxide), presenting the capability to self-assembly in micellar structures in aqueous medium forming polymeric micelles, which improve theirs potential as drug and genetic material nanocarriers. Thereby, in order to create new alternative treatments for current pathologies, like cancer, alterations in the poloxamines and poloxamers, the combination of these with other polymers and the conjugation with ligands are being introduced as a viable option to allow the combination of therapies, such as the simultaneous delivery of a gene and a drug in the same system. These intelligent stimuli-sensitive systems, with well-defined structures and functionalities, make possible the development of a safe, specific and effective therapeutic strategy. Thus, this article intends to review several aspects of poloxamines and poloxamers concerning their general properties and their applications in drug and gene delivery. Also, are reviewed the preparation and characterization techniques of polymeric micelles with a focus in micelleplexes which can be used as a simultaneous drug and nucleic acid carrier."
Losses of Cr content in plant samples using digestion procedures with acids,"In the WEPAL IPE 2009.2 proficiency test, Jožef Stefan Institute (JSI) participated by measuring Cr by k0-INAA; it was the only laboratory providing data by an instrumental technique. The JSI Cr result was about 38% higher than the assigned value in plant sample 124 (Lucerne/Medicago sativum). The same sample was again studied in 2012. This time, more labs, including JSI, used instrumental techniques and the average Cr result was higher and consistent with the 2009 and 2012 JSI results. From the results obtained in the present study, involving four INAA labs, it is confirmed that Cr losses in this sample occurred during the chemical digestion required by the techniques applied by other laboratories, illustrating the inherent advantage of nuclear techniques to be almost matrix independent and independent of the chemical state of the element under study."
Distributed approximation of k-service assignment,"We consider the k-Service Assignment problem (\(k\)-SA). The input consists of a network that contains servers and clients. Associated with each client is a demand and a profit. In addition, each client c has a service requirement, where \(\kappa (c)\) is a positive integer. A client c is satisfied only if its demand is handled by exactly \(\kappa (c)\) neighboring servers. The objective is to maximize the total profit of satisfied clients, while obeying the given capacity limits of the servers. We focus here on the more challenging case of hard constraints, where no profit is granted for partially satisfied clients. This models, e.g., when a client wants, for reasons of fault tolerance, a file to be stored at \(\kappa (c)\) or more nearby servers. Other motivations from the literature include resource allocation in 4G cellular networks and machine scheduling on related machines with assignment restrictions. In the r-restricted version of \(k\)-SA, no client requires more than an r-fraction of the capacity of any adjacent server. We present a (centralized) polynomial-time -approximation algorithm for r-restricted \(k\)-SA. A variant of this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of  when given a resource augmentation factor of \(1+r\). We use the latter result to present a -approximation algorithm for \(k\)-SA. In the distributed setting, we present: (i) a -approximation algorithm for r-restricted \(k\)-SA, (ii) a -approximation algorithm that uses a resource augmentation factor of \(1+r\) for r-restricted \(k\)-SA, both for any constant \(\varepsilon >0\), and (iii) an -approximation algorithm for \(k\)-SA (in expectation). The three distributed algorithms run in \(O(k^2 \varepsilon ^{-2} \log ^3 n)\) synchronous rounds (with high probability). In particular, this yields the first distributed -approximation of \(1\)-SA."
A Republican Argument Against Nudging and Informed Consent,"I argue that it is impermissible to use nudges as a tool to influence patients in the context of informed consent. The motivation for such nudges is that their use can help reconcile potential conflicts between a physician’s duty of beneficence and duty to respect patient autonomy. I argue that their use places physicians in a position of domination over patients. That is, it violates the republican freedom of patients because it grants physicians the power to arbitrarily interfere. I also argue that if one tries to adjust the duty of beneficence to avoid this conclusion, then the republican freedom of patients is still threatened under conditions of clinical equipoise. As ways to avoid the inevitability of nudging, I suggest the alternative of boosting or the pairing of patients with physicians who share their deep values. This latter option achieves the benefits nudging patients is supposed to provide without violating the republican freedom of those patients."
Cooperation in earth observation missions in Africa: a role for afrigeoss,"This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals. The paper reiterated that regardless of whether developed or developing, Earth observation information provides substantial benefit supporting economic development, decision making and policy implementation of all countries of the world. This is as a result of its multifarious benefits to humans in areas like agriculture, forestry, risk management, disaster monitoring, maritime, defence and security and natural resources management. Consequently, the paper argued that the numerous benefits from space assets have driven countries within the continent of Africa to either acquire or develop capabilities in space systems which is devoted to improving quality of life in general. The paper concluded that while space systems are expensive, there is need for continuity and sustainability as a result of its numerous advantages to the human’s society."
Quantum tomography for collider physics: illustrations with lepton-pair production,"Quantum tomography is a method to experimentally extract all that is observable about a quantum mechanical system. We introduce quantum tomography to collider physics with the illustration of the angular distribution of lepton pairs. The tomographic method bypasses much of the field-theoretic formalism to concentrate on what can be observed with experimental data. We provide a practical, experimentally driven guide to model-independent analysis using density matrices at every step. Comparison with traditional methods of analyzing angular correlations of inclusive reactions finds many advantages in the tomographic method, which include manifest Lorentz covariance, direct incorporation of positivity constraints, exhaustively complete polarization information, and new invariants free from frame conventions. For example, experimental data can determine the entanglement entropy of the production process. We give reproducible numerical examples and provide a supplemental standalone computer code that implements the procedure. We also highlight a property of complex positivity that guarantees in a least-squares type fit that a local minimum of a \(\chi ^{2}\) statistic will be a global minimum: There are no isolated local minima. This property with an automated implementation of positivity promises to mitigate issues relating to multiple minima and convention dependence that have been problematic in previous work on angular distributions."
Preterm Delivery as a Unique Pathophysiologic State Characterized by Maternal Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase 1 and Uterine Artery Resistance During Pregnancy: A Longitudinal Cohort Study,"Background: Preterm delivery (PTD) may be characterized by altered interrelationships among angiogenic factors and measures of placental function. We analyzed the longitudinal relationship between maternal serum concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (sFltI), an important antiangiogenic factor, and uterine artery resistance in pregnancies resulting in preterm and term deliveries. Methods: Data were collected in a longitudinal cohort study involving 278 women monitored at 6 to 10, 10 to 14, 16 to 20, 22 to 26, and 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. Concentrations of maternal serum sFltI were determined using solidphase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and uterine artery resistance indices (RI) were measured by Doppler velocimetry at each interval. Preterm delivery was defined as birth before 37-weeks completed gestation. Data analyses used multivariable repeated measures regression models. Results: Uterine artery RI decreased across gestation. As pregnancy progressed, RI trajectories diverged for term and preterm deliveries; the mean RI was significantly higher in third trimester for pregnancies resulting in PTD (P = .08). sFltI was stable through 21 3/7 weeks of gestation and then increased rapidly; women who delivered preterm had significantly higher sFltI levels in the third trimester (P =.04). The relationship between uterine artery RI and sFltI from the prior visit was significantly different between the groups (P < .0001). For term deliveries, higher sFltI concentrations were associated with a smaller RI at the subsequent visit (β = −.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.14 to −0.02). For PTD, higher sFltI concentrations were associated with a larger uterine artery RI (β = .14, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.22). Conclusion: PTD is characterized by altered relationships between angiogenic factors and placental vascular blood flow starting in early pregnancy."
Optimization of drilling delamination behavior of GFRP/clay nano-composites using RSM and GRA methods,"The effects of Nano-clay content on delamination factor during drilling operation on fiber-reinforced composites are optimized through Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Drilling is one of the basic operations on assembly section in many industries. In present work, the experiments are conducted by Box-Behnken Design (BBD) by RSM techniques, which is used to study influential factor on drilling process parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, size of drill and Nano-clay. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques are employed to evaluation of impact of process parameters on delamination. Developed regression models analyze the interaction properties of process parameters. In addition, the Gray Relational Analysis (GRA) is used to identify the best level of factors for both responses (Entry and Exit condition) to make quality of hole on composites. The experimental result shows that, the feed rate is the most significant factor among the other parameters. The delamination factor is decreased with addition of Nano-clay content at a certain percentile. Furthermore, of Nano-clay content, delamination factor may be increased. The proper propagation of filler content produces a high bonding between the fiber and matrix materials. Hence, the delamination factor may be decreased."
The effect of fabric density on the quality of digital printing on polyester,"One of the most important benefits of textile inkjet printing is the print quality. However, some factors affect the print quality, such as the weave density. In this research, the effect of weft density on the inkjet printing of polyester was investigated. Lines with different widths were printed in the warp and weft directions, and the print quality was evaluated as the line width. The obtained result showed that the weft density affected the line width and the print quality decreased with an increased weft density. The width of the lines printed in the weft direction is more than the width of lines printed in the warp direction. Also, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results confirmed the effect of the weft density and the printed lines direction on the line width and print quality. The investigation of the relation between the print quality and the vertical wicking shows a very poor relation between the two."
Evaluation of mechanical properties of jute/glass/carbon fibers reinforced hybrid composites,"A study on the tensile and flexural properties of jute-glass-carbon fibers reinforced epoxy hybrid composites in inter-ply configuration is presented in this paper. Test specimens were manufactured by hand lay-up process and their tensile and flexural properties were obtained. The effects of the hybridization, different fibers content and plies stacking sequence on the mechanical properties of the tested hybrid composites were investigated. Two-parameter Weibull distribution function was used to statistically analyze the experimental results. The failure probability graphs for the tested composites were drawn. These graphs are important tools for helping the designers to understand and choose the suitable material for the required design and development. Results showed that the hybridization process can potentially improve the tensile and flexural properties of jute reinforced composite. The flexural strength decreases when partial laminas from a carbon/epoxy laminate are replaced by glass/epoxy or jute/epoxy laminas. Also, it is realized that incorporating high strength fibers to the outer layers of the composite leads to higher flexural resistance, whilst the order of the layers doesn’t affect the tensile properties."
Prediction of diameter in blended nanofibers of polycaprolactone-gelatin using ANN and RSM,"Fabrication of nanofibers with a defined diameter is a primary purpose of the electrospinning process. The diameter of nanofiber is directly related to its individual features, such as mechanical property and porosity. The motivation to conduct the current study was to explore the diameter of hybrid nanofibers of polycaprolactone-gelatin (PCL-GT) as one of the most attractive scaffolds employed in various research fields, such as tissue engineering and industrial fields. We have developed two predictive models describing the electrospinning process of PCL-GT using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The effect of 4 variables on diameter was analyzed, including total polymer concentration, ratio of PCL to Gel, voltage, and tip-to-collector distance. The individual and interactive effects of the mentioned factors were analyzed using RSM. The total polymer concentration had the most significant individual effect on the diameter of PCL-Gel nanofiber, whereas the other three factors showed less strong individual effects, although, the interactive effects of these factors were more remarkable. It was demonstrated that both models, especially the ANN model, could accurately predict the diameter of PCL-GT nanofiber (regression coefficient > 0.92, mean absolute percentage error < 5.7). The represented predictive models could facilitate construction of electrospun nanofibers from PCL-Gel with wellcontrolled diameter required for any intended purpose."
Fabrication of hollow nanofibrous structures using a triple layering method for vascular scaffold applications,"This study aims to develop a new approach for fabricating hollow nanofibrous yarns by engineering a triple-layer structure (polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) multifilament core surrounded by a layer of PVA nanofibers and a polylactic acid (PLA) nanofiber outer layer). After fabrication of this 3-layer structure, the core portion was extracted, leaving the outer layer intact after dissolving the PVA nanofibers in water. To determine the optimum thickness of the outer layer, hollow nanofiber yarns with five different thicknesses were produced. A hollow nanofiber yarn was also produced using a common method to enable comparison of the methods. In the common method, a core sheath yarn consisting of a PVA multifilament core and a PLA nanofiber outer layer was fabricated, and a hollow yarn was produced by placing the core yarn in hot water. The results revealed facilitation of core extraction from the yarn body of the new 3-layer structure, which occurred due to rapid dissolution of the middle layer. The wicking behavior in the hollow yarn fabricated using the novel method followed the Locus Washburn equation and that of the hollow yarn produced from the core sheath yarn deviated from it. The results demonstrated that tensile properties of hollow nanofiber yarns were improved by increasing the thickness. Furthermore, hemolysis and cytotoxicity assays indicated that the fabricated hollow nanofibrous structure is non-toxic and blood compatible, indicating its potential for use in biomedical applications such as vascular scaffolds."
Degradation and kinetic modeling of polyvinyl alcohol in aqueous solutions by a H2O2/Mn(II) system,"This paper is about the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in aqueous solutions using a H2O2/Mn(II) system. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were applied to analyze the degradation products of PVA, and the results revealed that the backbone chain of PVA could be effectively broken and oxidized. Several unsaturated degradation products, including carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, olefins, and alkynes were also detected and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which indicated that higher treatment temperatures would considerably promote the generation of lower molecular weight degradation products. According to the work presented in this paper, the degradation efficiency of PVA increased from 55 % at 60 oC to 99 % at 90 oC after treatment when the initial PVA concentration was 5 %, at pH=3 with a H2O2 and Mn(II) dose of 100 ml/l and 0.6 mol/l, respectively. In addition, kinetic modeling indicated that the experimental results were best fitted by the Page-modified model with an activation energy of 48.78 kJ/mol."
Analytical expression for variance of homogeneous-position quantum walk with decoherent position,"We have derived an analytical expression for variance of homogeneous-position decoherent quantum walk with general form of noise on its position, and have shown that, while the quadratic (\(t^2\)) term of variance never changes by position decoherency, the linear term (t) does and always increases the variance. We study the walker with ability to tunnel out to d nearest neighbors as an example and compare our result with former studies. We also show that, although our expression has been derived for asymptotic case, the rapid decay of time-dependent terms causes the expressions to be correct with a good accuracy even after dozens of steps."
Development and Application of Artificial Neural Network,"Artificial neural network is a very important part in the new industry of artificial intelligence. In China, there are many researches on artificial neural network and artificial intelligence are developing rapidly. Therefore, this paper reviews and summarizes artificial neural network, and hopes that readers can get a deeper understanding of artificial neural network. This paper first reviews the development history of artificial neural network and its related theory, and introduces four major characteristics of artificial neural network, such as the non-linear, non-limitative, non-qualitative and non-convex. Then it emphatically analyzes its application in information, medicine, economy, control, transportation and psychology. Finally, the future development trend of artificial neural network is prospected and summarized."
Capability-Based Access Control with ECC Key Management for the M2M Local Cloud Platform,"One of the critical requirement in managing security of any computing system is access control, which includes protection and access management to the available resources. This requirement becomes more strict especially in a distributed computing environment that consists of constrained devices such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M). New challenges in access control are identified in a system comprises a group of distributed multiple M2M gateways forming a so called M2M local cloud platform (Vallati et al. in Wirel Trans Commun 87(3):1071–1091, 2016). Scalability is obviously a necessity which is lacking in some existing access control system. In addition, flexibility in managing access from users or entity belonging to other authorization domains as well as delegating access right are not provided as an integrated features. Lately, the capability-based access control has been suggested as method to manage access for M2M as the key enabler of Internet of Things. In this paper, a capability based access control equipped with Elliptic Curve Cryptography based key management is proposed for the M2M local cloud platform. The feasibility of the proposed capability based access control and key management are tested by implementing them within the security manager that is part of the overall component of the platform architecture, and evaluating their performances by a series of experimentations."
A Pragmatic System to Support Virtual Assembly for Military Armored Vehicle Integrated Transmission System in the Virtual Environment,"The integrated transmission system of military armored vehicle is a kind of complex transmission system, which includes power transfer, power shifting, steering and manipulation. The transmission system is the key component for realizing the overall system functions of military armored vehicle. The rationality of structure design and feasibility of assembly are the precondition for implementation of function of transmission system, which are inseparable with the step of assembly design. In order to provide a prediction for the two designs in design stage of integrated transmission system, a pragmatic system to support virtual assembly for military armored vehicle integrated transmission system is established in this paper. In the virtual assembly system, the reconstruction method of assembly features of transmission system is investigated to implement the models transform from CAD system to virtual assembly. The planning method of virtual assembly sequence is proposed, which is based on the combination of cut set method of graph theory with interactive planning in virtual environment. The sequence planning method applied the pre-identified strategy for the subassembly to improve combination explosion problem of cut set method and reduce the blindness and uncertainty caused by the direct using of interactive planning. The mixed collision checking method based on the geometrical features is presented, which can meet the real-time performance and accuracy of virtual assembly. The parts accurate positioning method based on the reconstruction of assembly features elements is proposed, which can be used for the accurate positioning in virtual environment. With these technologies and methods, the system has been successfully applied to the virtual assembly for a certain type of integrated transmission system of military armored vehicle."
Distributed and Adaptive Analog Coding for Video Broadcast in Wireless Cooperative System,"Recently, some analog joint source-channel coding (AJSCC) schemes have been proposed to deal with cliff effect in wireless video broadcasting system. And wireless video broadcast with user cooperation tends to be a promising way to improve broadcast video quality in the near future. In this paper, we introduce a distributed and adaptive analog coding scheme called ACVC (adaptive cooperative video coding) based on AJSCC and with the concept of coset coding in distributed source coding, to improve the overall video broadcast quality in wireless cooperative system. Particularly, an adaptive packet discarding module is introduced to the framework to avoid video quality deterioration under severe channel conditions. And a model for quantization step selection of coset coding is built to minimize the redundancy in the cooperative signal and improve the anti-noise ability of the video. The experimental results show that, ACVC has stronger adaptability and thus obtains higher quality of broadcasted video than existing wireless cooperative schemes in the literature under different channel conditions."
Colouring of \((P_3 \cup P_2)\)-free graphs,"The class of \(2K_{2}\)-free graphs and its various subclasses have been studied in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we are concerned with the colouring of \((P_{3}\cup P_{2})\)-free graphs, a super class of \(2K_{2}\)-free graphs. We derive a \(O(\omega ^{3})\) upper bound for the chromatic number of \((P_{3} \cup P_{2})\)-free graphs, and sharper bounds for \((P_{3} \cup P_{2}\), diamond)-free graphs and for \((2K_{2},\) diamond)-free graphs, where \(\omega \) denotes the clique number. The last two classes are perfect if \(\omega \ge 5\) and \(\ge 4\) respectively."
Reactive dyeing of ramie yarn washed by liquid ammonia,"The washing efficiency of water, nonionic soap solution, reflux solution, pure liquid ammonia (99.99%), and solvated liquid ammonia was studied on dyed ramie yarns. The ramie yarn samples were dyed with a 2% on weight of fiber (o.w.f) shade with five types of reactive dye by the classical exhaustion method. The washing performances of these solvents were quantified by the dye removal rate, the color uniformity, and the color fastness properties (washing, rubbing, and lightness). Furthermore, the influence of these wash methods on the physical properties of the final yarn samples including shrinkage, tensile strength, and elongation was schematically examined. The results of these measurements revealed that the dye removal rates during the washing in pure liquid ammonia and solvated liquid ammonia were lower than the yarn washed in water, soap solutions, or reflux solutions. The color uniformity (expressed as the standard deviation of K/S values for all dyed ramie yarns) was within the acceptable limits with the satisfactory color fastness levels. The shrinkage values of yarns that were washed in the pure liquid ammonia and the solvated liquid ammonia were both similar (9.0%) and considerably higher than the samples washed in water (1.8%), soap solution (2.4%), or reflux solution (2.6%). The tensile strength and the elongation of the resultant yarns improved significantly when the samples washed in pure liquid ammonia. The yarns that were washed in the solvated liquid ammonia solutions had decreased tensile strength and elongation. The cause of the decrease was determined by the XRD measurements, which confirmed that the crystallinity, and the orientation of these fibers decreased dramatically after being washed in the ammonia system solutions. The samples that were washed in the liquid ammonia had a smoother surface morphology than the other washing processes."
Preparation and characterization of individual chitin nanofibers with high stability from chitin gels by low-intensity ultrasonication for antibacterial finishing,"Individual chitin nanofibers with high stability were feasibly prepared from chitin gel via low-intensity ultrasonication. The morphology of the treated gel could be controlled from nanoparticles to nanofibers by simply adjusting the ultrasonic time. The nanofibers had a nanoscaled width and an average length of 650 nm. Compared with original chitin gel, the chemical structure, α-chitin crystalline structure and thermo stability of chitin nanofibers were well maintained after the treatment. TGA results proved that nanofibers were obtained by hydrogen bonding structure’s reorganization of chitin gel which was driven by ultrasonication. These nanofibers had high suspension stability and were used as finishing agent for cotton fabric. The SEM result showed that chitin nanofibers had good compatibility to cotton fabrics. The finished cotton fabric had a low color difference of 4.88 to raw cotton fabric and an antibacterial activity with 99% bacterial reductions. Our results indicate that this cost-effective and eco-friendly product holds immense potential value in textile industry for antibacterial finishing application."
N-terminal tagging of human P2X7 receptor disturbs calcium influx and dye uptake,"The P2X7 receptor is a frequently studied member of the purinergic receptor family signalling via channel opening and membrane pore formation. Fluorescent imaging is an important molecular method for studying cellular receptor expression and localization. Fusion of receptors to fluorescent proteins might cause major functional changes and requires careful functional evaluation such as has been done for the rat P2X7 receptor. This study examines fusion constructs of the human P2X7 receptor. We assessed surface expression, channel opening with calcium influx, and pore formation using YO-PRO-1 dye uptake in response to BzATP stimulation in transfected cells. We found that tagging at the N-terminal of the human P2X7 receptor with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) disturbed channel opening and pore formation despite intact surface expression. A triple hemagglutinin (3HA) fused to the N-terminal also disrupted pore formation but not channel opening showing that even a small tag alters the normal function of the receptor. Together, this suggests that in contrast to what has been observed for the rat P2X7 receptor, the human P2X7 receptor contains N-terminal motifs important for signalling that prevent the construction of a functionally active fusion protein."
Dropping the base: recovery from extreme hypercarbia in the CO2 tolerant Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii),"Hagfish are capable of tolerating extreme hypercapnia (> 30 Torr) by mounting substantial plasma [HCO3−] (hypercarbia) to compensate for CO2-mediated acidosis. The goal of this study was to characterize the mechanistic hypercarbia-recovery strategies in the highly CO2 tolerant hagfish. We exposed hagfish to hypercapnia (30 Torr) for 48 h and allowed a 24 h recovery period in normocapnic seawater. Within 8 h of the recovery period, the compensatory plasma [HCO3−] load (~ 70 mmol L−1) was rapidly offloaded. While increases in both whole-animal HCO3− excretion and glomerular filtration were observed throughout recovery (2–8 h), neither can fully account for the observed rates of whole-animal HCO3− loss, which peaked at ~ 3.5 mmol kg−1 h−1. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase via acetazolamide revealed that the restoration of plasma [HCO3−] from hypercapnia-induced hypercarbia is likely facilitated in a dualistic manner, initially relying on both carbonic anhydrase mediated CO2 offloading and Cl−/HCO3− exchange processes, both of which are likely either upregulated or further activated as recovery progresses."
Climatically driven yield variability of major crops in Khakassia (South Siberia),"We investigated the variability of yield of the three main crop cultures in the Khakassia Republic: spring wheat, spring barley, and oats. In terms of yield values, variability characteristics, and climatic response, the agricultural territory of Khakassia can be divided into three zones: (1) the Northern Zone, where crops yield has a high positive response to the amount of precipitation, May–July, and a moderately negative one to the temperatures of the same period; (2) the Central Zone, where crops yield depends mainly on temperatures; and (3) the Southern Zone, where climate has the least expressed impact on yield. The dominant pattern in the crops yield is caused by water stress during periods of high temperatures and low moisture supply with heat stress as additional reason. Differences between zones are due to combinations of temperature latitudinal gradient, precipitation altitudinal gradient, and the presence of a well-developed hydrological network and the irrigational system as moisture sources in the Central Zone. More detailed analysis shows differences in the climatic sensitivity of crops during phases of their vegetative growth and grain development and, to a lesser extent, during harvesting period. Multifactor linear regression models were constructed to estimate climate- and autocorrelation-induced variability of the crops yield. These models allowed prediction of the possibility of yield decreasing by at least 2–11% in the next decade due to increasing of the regional summer temperatures."
Lattice Boltzmann simulations of high-order statistics in isotropic turbulent flows,"The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is coupled with the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision model and the three-dimensional 19-discrete-velocity (D3Q19) model to resolve intermittent behaviors on small scales in isotropic turbulent flows. The high-order scaling exponents of the velocity structure functions, the probability distribution functions of Lagrangian accelerations, and the local energy dissipation rates are investigated. The self-similarity of the space-time velocity structure functions is explored using the extended self-similarity (ESS) method, which was originally developed for velocity spatial structure functions. The scaling exponents of spatial structure functions at up to ten orders are consistent with the experimental measurements and theoretical results, implying that the LBM can accurately resolve the intermittent behaviors. This validation provides a solid basis for using the LBM to study more complex processes that are sensitive to small scales in turbulent flows, such as the relative dispersion of pollutants and mesoscale structures of preferential concentration of heavy particles suspended in turbulent flows."
Effects of IBA on the rooting of branch cuttings of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.) and changes to nutrients and endogenous hormones,"‘Zhongqiusucui’ jujube secondary shoots were treated with 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA) at three concentrations, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/L. Results show that IBA could significantly enhance rooting and root characteristics of cuttings and were best with IBA at 1500 mg/L. In the rooting process, the formation of adventitious roots was related to the consumption and accumulation of nutrients (soluble sugars and proteins) and the changes in endogenous hormones in phloem, leaf tips and leaf bases. The rooting of cuttings had a positive correlation with the consumption of soluble sugars during the period of callus formation and with the accumulation of soluble sugars during adventitious root formation and growth. Rooting was positively related to the breakdown of soluble proteins in the phloem when the callus formed, and had a positive correlation with its accumulation during adventitious root formation and growth. Leaf tips and leaf bases showed a reverse trend in changes of soluble protein. However, together with the phloem, leaf tips and leaf bases regulated and controlled the formation and development of adventitious roots. The main activities of soluble proteins exist in the leaf tips as this was the main source of soluble proteins. The relation between rooting and IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) content in phloem was positive and thus a high concentration of IAA could benefit the induction and formation of adventitious roots. However, rooting was negatively related with ABA (abscisic acid) and GA (gibberellic acid) and a high concentration of both could inhibit the induction and formation of adventitious roots. Rooting had a positive correlation with phloem IAA/ABA ratios, and higher ratios could improve rooting. Low concentrations of ZR (zeatin riboside) triggered the induction of adventitious roots, while higher concentrations promoted root growth. Endogenous hormones in leaf tips and bases had an impact on rooting. The activities of endogenous hormones mainly existed in leaf tips because they play a major role in the production and consumption of IAA and its ABA content increased during rooting. The ZR in leaf tips influenced the rooting of cuttings, especially in the callus formation and rooting stage. Leaf tips were the main source of GA."
Ectomycorrhizal fungus enhances drought tolerance of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings and improves soil condition,"Mongolian pine is an important afforestation species widely used for ecological management in northeast China. The environment in this region is very unstable and the flora are regularly subjected to drought stress. This paper reports on the influence of inoculation with the Suillus luteus on seedlings under different water conditions. Both inoculated and non-inoculated ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF)-S. luteus seedlings were maintained under well-watered or water-stress conditions for 3 months. The S. luteus colonization rate under water stress was higher than that in well-watered conditions. Under water stress, inoculated seedlings had greater growth than non-inoculated seedlings. In addition, under water stress, S. luteus-inoculated seedlings had greater superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity, higher soluble protein content, lower proline content, and lower malondialdehyde content than non-inoculated seedlings. S. luteus colonization increased the rhizosphere soil-enzyme activity and the rhizosphere soil nutrition content under both well-watered and water-stress conditions. Given the positive impact on seedling growth and physiology, S. luteus shows potential for use in the arid and semi-arid regions of northeast China for afforestation."
"Role of Firing Temperature, Sheet Resistance, and Contact Area in Contact Formation on Screen-Printed Metal Contact 
of Silicon Solar Cell","Formation of an Ohmic contact requires a suitable firing temperature, appropriate doping profile, and contact dimensions within resolution limits of the screen-printing process. In this study, the role of the peak firing temperature in standard rapid thermal annealing (RTA) six-zone conveyor belt furnace (CBF) and two inexpensive alternate RTA systems [a custom-designed, three-zone, 5″-diameter quartz tube furnace (QTF) and a tabletop, 3″-diameter rapid thermal processing (RTP)] has been investigated. In addition, the role of sheet resistance and contact area in achieving low-resistance ohmic contacts has been examined. Electrical measurements of ohmic contacts between silver paste/n
+-emitter layer with varying sheet resistances and aluminum paste/p-doped wafer were carried out in transmission line method configuration. Experimental measurements of the contact resistivity (ρ
c) exhibited the lowest values for CBF at 0.14 mΩ cm2 for Ag and 100 mΩ cm2 for Al at a peak firing temperature of 870°C. For the QTF configuration, lowest measured contact resistivities were 3.1 mΩ cm2 for Ag and 74.1 mΩ cm2 for Al at a peak firing temperature of 925°C. Finally, for the RTP configuration, lowest measured contact resistivities were 1.2 mΩ cm2 for Ag and 68.5 mΩ cm2 for Al at a peak firing temperature of 780°C. The measured contact resistivity exhibits strong linear dependence on sheet resistance. The contact resistivity for Ag decreases with contact area, while for Al the opposite behavior is observed."
On embedding certain Kazhdan–Lusztig cells of \(S_n\) into cells of \(S_{n+1}\),"In this paper, we consider a particular class of Kazhdan–Lusztig cells in the symmetric group \(S_n\), the cells containing involutions associated with compositions \(\lambda \) of n. For certain families of compositions we are able to give an explicit description of the corresponding cells by obtaining reduced forms for all their elements. This is achieved by first finding a particular class of diagrams \({\mathcal {E}}^{(\lambda )}\) which lead to a subset of the cell from which the remaining elements of the cell are easily obtained. Moreover, we show that for certain cases of related compositions \(\lambda \) and \(\hat{\lambda }\) of n and \(n+1\) respectively, the members of \({\mathcal {E}}^{(\lambda )}\) and \({\mathcal {E}}^{(\hat{\lambda })}\) are also related in an analogous way. This allows us to associate certain cells in \(S_n\) with cells in \(S_{n+1}\) in a well-defined way, which is connected to the induction and restriction of cells."
Duplication and gene expression patterns of β-catenin in Nile tilapia,"β-Catenin, a key transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt pathway, plays an important role in animal embryonic development and organogenesis. In our earlier study, we have reported that two types of β-catenin (β-catenin-1 and β-catenin-2) were ubiquitously expressed in almost all the tissues examined in tilapia. However, the immunolocalization of β-catenin in those tissues, especially in extra-gonadal tissues, remains unclear. In the present study, we further confirm that these two types of β-catenin gene exist only in teleosts and are derived from 3R (third round of genome duplication) by phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis conducted in this investigation reveals that two β-catenins exhibited similar expression patterns in seven adult tissues and four key developmental stages of XX and XY gonads. Finally, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect the cell localization of β-catenin. A positive signal of β-catenin was observed in various tissues of tilapia, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, eye, brain, and gonads. The results of our study indicate that tilapia β-catenin might be involved in the organ development and play some specific functions in biological processes; all these data will provide basic reference for understanding the molecular mechanism of β-catenin in regulating of teleost organogenesis."
Breeding biology of Chalk-browed Mockingbird Mimus saturninus in a natural savanna of central Brazil,"The Chalk-browed Mockingbird Mimus saturninus (Mimidae) is a common bird in savannas, grasslands, and farmlands, also occurring in urban areas. We studied its breeding biology in a Cerrado savanna inside a reserve at central Brazil, from 2003 to 2013. We monitored 74 nests, which were usually found in the more open phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado. The breeding season lasted from late August to late December. The nest is a cup built with twigs and generally placed on shrubs and small trees. Mean nest height above the ground was 1.3 ± 0.5 m (n = 73). Mean clutch size was of 2.9 ± 0.9 eggs (n = 63), ranging from one (possibly an incomplete clutch) to six eggs (possibly a communal nest). Incubation was asynchronous, the incubation period lasted 14.2 ± 0.9 days (n = 17 nests), and the nestling period lasted 14.1 ± 1.2 days (n = 21 nests). Nestling infestation by botfly larvae was common (60% of nests), but did not cause any nest loss. Its breeding season was similar to most birds of the Cerrado region, but its clutch size was larger. The Chalk-browed Mockingbird breeding biology in central Brazil is similar to that reported from the southern part of its distribution. The species is capable of multiple broods, has cooperative breeding and shows evidence of communal breeding, a rare behavior reported so far for Mimidae. The main difference between our study and those conducted with the Chalk-browed Mockingbird in Argentina, is the very low prevalence of brood parasites, demonstrating the importance of reserves to allow breeding with low brood parasitism rates."
"Twenty years later: an update to the birds of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Amazonas, Brazil","Although species lists from throughout Amazonia have become available, relatively complete inventories based on longterm work remain rare. Longitudinal comparisons at well-studied sites provide the best opportunities for describing communities and identifying changes in regional avifaunas. Within central Amazonia, no region has received as much consistent ornithological coverage as the terra firme forests north of Manaus, Brazil, at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Here we provide an updated list of the area, including notes on all species added between 1997 and 2017. We recorded 21 species new for the site, most of which (>75%) are birds that prefer várzea or second-growth forest. This brings the cumulative BDFFP list up to 409 species, the majority (66%) of which inhabit primary terra firme forest. Together, this confirms that the regional terra firme community had been well-characterized by the 1990s, and that species additions to the list over the last 20 years are consistent with a changing landscape as urbanization, agriculture, and second-growth spread from Manaus. The final product continues to represent the most complete avian inventory for a single site in all of lowland Amazonia."
Report on the Dynamic Monitoring of Health and Family Planning Services for Migrant Populations in 2015,
"Parity, Timing and Level of Fertility: A Comparative Study on Mean Age at Childbearing in China, Japan and South Korea","Using fertility data from national surveys and population censuses for China, Japan and South Korea, this study analyzes the levels and trends of mean age at childbearing (MAC) in the three countries from 1990 to 2015. After using the decomposition technique to isolate the effects of parity composition and childbearing schedule in each of the three countries, the article presents a quantitative examination of the factors that underlie dynamic changes and cross-national differences of MACs. Results indicate that the MAC of China experienced a decrease between 1990 and 1995, followed by sustained growth afterwards. The increase of MAC in China has been driven by the postponement of childbearing and changes in parity composition, with the former playing a larger role. The mechanisms underlying the patterns since 2010 deserve special attention. Compared with Japan and South Korea, China has had relatively lower MAC during the last 25 years; the three countries demonstrate different patterns in terms of the roles of parity composition and birth timing. The accuracy of MAC in identifying the timing of period fertility and the policy implications of timing on upturning fertility level are discussed."
"Returned Migrants, Family Capital and Entrepreneurship in Rural China","This paper introduces an interaction item consisting of migration experience and family capital into a rural labor employment selection model. It analyzes how migration experience helps eliminate resource constraints in rural areas and facilitates the participation of rural workers in entrepreneurship. We find that the length of time migrants work in migrant inflow areas exerts a significantly positive influence on the non-agricultural employment of returned migrants. We also find that those returned migrants who have worked in the service industry prefer to work for local enterprises. Furthermore, returned migrant workers with business experience tend to start their own businesses upon returning home. Compared with non-migrants, returned migrants are more capable of utilizing their rural family capital in the entrepreneurial process. These findings suggest that both migration experience and family capital promote local employment and entrepreneurship in rural areas, despite the fact that they are subject to the imperfect rural market mechanism and lack adequate social support."
Population Migration and Brain Drain in Northeast China,"Migration has been the main driver during the last decade of population change in Northeast China, an area made up of three provinces, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning. A net out flow of population has resulted in the loss of younger laborers in the area. More than two million people migrate out of Northeast China, and the number is increasing. The flow direction is from north to south. Liaoning in the south is a province of net in-migration, and Jilin and Heilongjiang in the north are provinces of net out-migration. There are large differences in the education and age structure of inflow and outflow migrants; the out-flow areas are losing human capital. This study uses a Dynamic Monitoring Survey of Migrant Population to analyze population flows in Northeast China, and uses employment information for university graduates to analyze the problem of brain drain in this area."
Cooperation in earth observation missions in Africa: a role for afrigeoss,"This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals. The paper reiterated that regardless of whether developed or developing, Earth observation information provides substantial benefit supporting economic development, decision making and policy implementation of all countries of the world. This is as a result of its multifarious benefits to humans in areas like agriculture, forestry, risk management, disaster monitoring, maritime, defence and security and natural resources management. Consequently, the paper argued that the numerous benefits from space assets have driven countries within the continent of Africa to either acquire or develop capabilities in space systems which is devoted to improving quality of life in general. The paper concluded that while space systems are expensive, there is need for continuity and sustainability as a result of its numerous advantages to the human’s society."
Significant Engagement in Tanning Behaviors by Men at a U.S. University,"Adolescent and young adult men are a potentially overlooked population with respect to risky tanning behaviors. This study sought to determine the prevalence of various modes of tanning and associated variables among young men in a university setting in the southeastern United States. Undergraduate students at a public institution in Mobile, Alabama were surveyed electronically in March 2016. Of the 818 undergraduate men surveyed, over 90% reported tanning behaviors, with 37% reporting engaging in indoor tanning. Additionally, over 25% reported engaging in two or more types of tanning concurrently. These findings indicate that early intervention efforts targeting young men are needed to reduce risky tanning behaviors and associated negative health outcomes."
"Trends in Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Childhood Asthma in Miami, Florida: 2005–2013","Nationally, racial and ethnic disparities in childhood asthma plateaued from 2005 to 2013. We assessed trends in childhood asthma in Miami, Florida using Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data and emergency department (ED) utilization and hospitalization rates by zip code population characteristics. Asthma prevalence in Miami did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity in YRBSS respondents in 2005 (16.2–17.2%, all groups), but rose in African–Americans and Hispanics and declined in Whites by 2013 to 27.9, 20.9 and 12.6%, respectively (P = 0.02). Median asthma ED visit rates rose from 106.8 (2006–2008) to 138.2 (2011–2013; P = 0.004) per 10,000 children. High-poverty and majority African–American zip codes were 6.3 and 7.3 times more likely to have asthma ED visit rates > 200 than others (P < 0.001). In high-poverty zip codes, majority African–American population was not associated with significantly higher ED utilization. In low-poverty zip codes, the association became stronger. Greater poverty explains much, but not all of Miami African–Americans’ higher asthma risk."
"Structural, electrical and magnetic study of multiferroic Bi1 − xNdxFeO3","The multiferroic Bi1 − xNdxFeO3 polycrystalline samples were prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction method and were observed to possess the desired phase, i.e., the single-phase. X-ray diffraction of the prepared samples was performed to analyse the crystal structure and to determine the lattice parameters. IR technique was used to recognise and understand the bonding nature of the prepared samples. The ferroelectric nature was identified by taking the P–E loops at various applied voltages, showing improvement in values of remnant polarisation and spontaneous polarisation. The J–E characteristics reveal the resistivity of all the prepared samples and found to have been enhanced largely in Nd-doped samples. The room temperature magnetic hysteresis measurements showed growth in the magnetisation due to the change in structure and spin cycloidal partial destruction produced due to Nd doping in BFO ceramics."
A Republican Argument Against Nudging and Informed Consent,"I argue that it is impermissible to use nudges as a tool to influence patients in the context of informed consent. The motivation for such nudges is that their use can help reconcile potential conflicts between a physician’s duty of beneficence and duty to respect patient autonomy. I argue that their use places physicians in a position of domination over patients. That is, it violates the republican freedom of patients because it grants physicians the power to arbitrarily interfere. I also argue that if one tries to adjust the duty of beneficence to avoid this conclusion, then the republican freedom of patients is still threatened under conditions of clinical equipoise. As ways to avoid the inevitability of nudging, I suggest the alternative of boosting or the pairing of patients with physicians who share their deep values. This latter option achieves the benefits nudging patients is supposed to provide without violating the republican freedom of those patients."
Distributed approximation of k-service assignment,"We consider the k-Service Assignment problem (\(k\)-SA). The input consists of a network that contains servers and clients. Associated with each client is a demand and a profit. In addition, each client c has a service requirement, where \(\kappa (c)\) is a positive integer. A client c is satisfied only if its demand is handled by exactly \(\kappa (c)\) neighboring servers. The objective is to maximize the total profit of satisfied clients, while obeying the given capacity limits of the servers. We focus here on the more challenging case of hard constraints, where no profit is granted for partially satisfied clients. This models, e.g., when a client wants, for reasons of fault tolerance, a file to be stored at \(\kappa (c)\) or more nearby servers. Other motivations from the literature include resource allocation in 4G cellular networks and machine scheduling on related machines with assignment restrictions. In the r-restricted version of \(k\)-SA, no client requires more than an r-fraction of the capacity of any adjacent server. We present a (centralized) polynomial-time -approximation algorithm for r-restricted \(k\)-SA. A variant of this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of  when given a resource augmentation factor of \(1+r\). We use the latter result to present a -approximation algorithm for \(k\)-SA. In the distributed setting, we present: (i) a -approximation algorithm for r-restricted \(k\)-SA, (ii) a -approximation algorithm that uses a resource augmentation factor of \(1+r\) for r-restricted \(k\)-SA, both for any constant \(\varepsilon >0\), and (iii) an -approximation algorithm for \(k\)-SA (in expectation). The three distributed algorithms run in \(O(k^2 \varepsilon ^{-2} \log ^3 n)\) synchronous rounds (with high probability). In particular, this yields the first distributed -approximation of \(1\)-SA."
TOPSIS with similarity measure for MADM applied to network selection,"In this article, a new method is introduced to handle fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making problems. The method preserves fuzziness in the preference technique to avoid the drawbacks of defuzzification. The study modifies the technique of order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) for interval-valued fuzzy numbers. The traditional TOPSIS uses the relative degree of closeness to rank the alternatives. Instead, a similarity measure based on map distance is used for preference. The degree of similarity between each attribute of an alternative and the ideal solution is computed, and a similarity matrix is formed. Then, the total degree of similarity for all the attributes of an alternative is used for ranking. The alternative corresponding to the one norm of the similarity matrix is the best alternative. Thus, the comparison is done on a fuzzy basis to avoid the loss of information due to converting the elements of the weighted normalized decision matrix to crisp values by defuzzification. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the approach. A practical example in network selection to optimize vertical hand offs is solved where both user preferences and network parameters are treated as interval-valued fuzzy numbers."
A multi-institution phase II study of docetaxel and S-1 in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (DASH study),Trastuzumab when combined with fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin was proven to improve survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive gastric cancer (GC) in the ToGA study. The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel and S-1 have not yet been evaluated.
Comparative transcriptome analysis of two citrus germplasms with contrasting susceptibility to Phytophthora nicotianae provides new insights into tolerance mechanisms,"Host perception of Phytophthora nicotianae switching to necrotrophy is fundamental for disease tolerance of citrus. It involves an HR-like response, strengthening of the cell wall structure and hormonal signaling."
Gum Dammar and poly(acrylamide)-based hydrogels and zirconium-based organic-inorganic hybrid materials for controlled drug delivery and their biodegradation studies,"The present research work was aimed at the use of pre-synthesized Gum Dammar and poly(AAm)-based polymeric networks (hydrogel) and zirconium-based Gd-cl-poly(AAm)-ZIO organo-inorganic hybrid networks (ion exchanger) for in situ release of metformin hydrochloride under different pH conditions such as 4.0, 7.0 and 9.2 at 37 °C. Further biodegradation studies of the samples were also done using soil burial and soil composting method. It has been observed from the release dynamics of the drug that the diffusion exponent ‘n’ under different pH conditions is between 0.1 and 0.7 in case of hydrogel and between 0.09 and 0.7 in case of organo-inorganic hybrid material. It can be inferred from the values of the ‘n’ that the release of drug in different pH conditions is pH responsive. Hence these materials can be exploited as drug delivery devices. The initial diffusion coefficient has a greater value than the later diffusion coefficient indicating a higher drug release rate during the early stage. Different stages of biodegradation were characterized using scanning electron microscopic studies."
"Phase I trial to evaluate the addition of alisertib to fulvestrant in women with endocrine-resistant, ER+ metastatic breast cancer","In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer models, activation of Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is associated with downregulation of ERα expression and resistance to endocrine therapy. Alisertib is an oral selective inhibitor of AURKA. The primary objectives of this phase I trial were to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate the toxicities and clinical activity of alisertib combined with fulvestrant in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC)."
Fabrication and characterization of multi-layer InAs/InGaAs quantum dot p-i-n GaAs solar cells grown on silicon substrates,"This paper reports on InAs/InGaAs quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on (001) n-type silicon (n-Si) substrates. In-situ RHEED measurements show that InAs/InGaAs QDs SC has a high crystalline structure. The dislocation density in the active layer of the InAs/InGaAs QDSC and the lattice mismatch in the GaAs layer can be reduced by using an Si rough surface buffer layer (RSi). To show the effect of the QD layers, a reference SC with the same p-i-n structure as the InAs/InGaAs QDSC, but without InAs QDs, is also grown. The two SCs were studied by sepectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), in the 1–6 eV photon energy range, photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements. The optical constants of the two devices are determined in the photon energy range 1–6 eV from the SE data. The dominant features in the dielectric function spectra at ~ 3 and ~ 4.5 eV are attributed, respectively, to the E1 and E2 critical point structures of GaAs and InAs. The low-temperature photoluminescence spectrum of the InAs/InGaAs QDSC shows ground-state emissions, respectively, from the relatively small QDs near 1081 nm and from the large QDs near 1126 nm. Photocurrent measurements confirm the improved absorption performance (up to 1200 nm) of the InAs QDs SC which is ascribed to the optical absorption from the InAs/InGaAs QDs and the Si substrate as demonstrated by SE and photoluminescence measurements."
Prevalence of Mental Disorders Among Children and Adolescents of Parents with Self-Reported Mental Health Problems,"This paper provides Australian population-level estimates of the prevalence of parental self-reported lifetime mental disorders and past 12 month mental disorders in their children. It leverages unique data from the 2013–2014 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (Young Minds Matter) (n = 6310). Mental disorders were assessed in 4–17 year-olds using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV. Primary carer (PC) and secondary carer mental health was based on PC-reported lifetime diagnoses. Over one-third of 4–17 year-olds had a PC with a lifetime diagnosis. The prevalence of all disorders was significantly higher amongst these children than children whose PC reported no diagnoses, and highest when the PC had comorbid and more severe disorders. Assessing mental health needs at a family level is important to identify children who are particularly vulnerable to developing mental disorders, to develop targeted interventions, and to understand the intergenerational transmission of risk."
"Effect of injection pressure on performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of diesel–acetylene-fuelled single cylinder stationary CI engine","In this paper, the effect of injection pressure on the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel-acetylene fuelled single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) diesel engine with a rated power of 3.5 kW at a rated speed of 1500 rpm was studied. Experiments were performed in dual-fuel mode at four different injection pressures of 180, 190, 200, and 210 bar with a flow rate of 120 LPH of acetylene and results were compared with that of baseline diesel operation. Experimental results showed that highest brake thermal efficiency of 27.57% was achieved at injection pressure of 200 bar for diesel-acetylene dual-fuel mode which was much higher than 23.32% obtained for baseline diesel. Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emissions were also measured and found to be lower, while the NO
x
 emissions were higher at 200 bar in dual fuel mode as compared to those in other injection pressures in dual fuel mode and also for baseline diesel mode. Peak cylinder pressure, net heat release rate, and rate of pressure rise were also calculated and were higher at 200 bar injection pressure in dual fuel mode."
Effect of high hydrostatic pressure on background microflora and furan formation in fruit purée based baby foods,"The baby foods industry is currently seeking technologies to pasteurize products without formation of processing contaminants such as furan. This work demonstrates the applicability of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) as a non-thermal decontamination intervention for fruit purée based baby foods. HHP processing was evaluated at 200, 300, and 400 MPa pressures, for 5, 10 and 15 min of treatment times at 25, 35 and 45 °C. HHP application at 400 MPa, 45 °C for 15 min ensured complete inactivation (about 6 log10) of total mesophilic aerophiles, as well as yeasts and molds. No furan was detected in HHP processed products. Thus, the key advantage of HHP over thermal processing is the ability to achieve commercially acceptable microbiological inactivation while avoiding the formation of processing contaminants such as furan."
Elucidating potential utilization of Portuguese common bean varieties in rice based processed foods,"The present study was aimed at studying the physico-chemical and functional properties of 31 Portuguese common bean varieties. In addition, the whole bean flours (WBF) and starch isolates (SI) of three representative bean varieties and their rice: bean blends (70:30; 50:50) were assessed for amylose content, thermal and pasting properties in view of supplementation in rice based processed foods. Bean varieties showed significant differences in protein content (20.78–27.10%), fat content (1.16–2.18%), hydration capacity (95.90–149.30%), unhydrated seeds (4.00–40.00%), γ tocopherol (3.20–98.05 mg/100 g fat), δ tocopherol (0.06–4.72 mg/100 g fat) and pasting behavior. Amylose content of WBF (11.4–20.2%) was significantly lower than rice flour (23.51%) whereas SI of beans (40.00–47.26%) had significantly higher amylose content than SI of rice (28.13%). DSC results showed that WBF (11.4–20.2 °C) had significantly broader and lower gelatinization temperature range (∆Tr) than corresponding SI (20.9–23.1 °C). WBF had significantly lower pasting viscosity due to low starch content and compositional matrix effect as compared to SI. Setback viscosities of WBF and rice: bean blends was lower than rice flour. Low setback viscosities of rice:bean blends may be used to prevent syneresis and stabilizing the quality of frozen foods in rice based processed foods."
"Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and reproductive outcomes of polycystic ovary syndrome in older women referred for tertiary fertility care","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive age women. The clinical symptoms of PCOS vary with female age, as older women tend to have lower hyperandrogenic symptoms and many regain regular cycles. In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of PCOS among older women referred for fertility care, describe their clinical characteristics, and compare their reproductive outcomes to those of matched control group."
Money Over Marriage: Marriage Importance as a Mediator Between Materialism and Marital Satisfaction,"While the negative relationship between materialism and marital satisfaction is well documented, mediators that possibly explain this association have not been widely explored. Based on the Incompatibility of Materialism and Children Model and Marital Paradigms Theory, this article explores the perception of marriage importance as a potential mediator between materialism and marital satisfaction. Using a sample of 1310 married individuals, we found evidence of partial mediation in that materialism was negatively associated with perception of marriage importance, and this association partially explained why being materialistic was associated with lower marital satisfaction. Thus, as counselors, therapists, and financial planners work with married clients, it is important that they consider how their clients’ materialistic tendencies may influence the family both financially and relationally. Suggestions for future research are discussed."
Neo-fuzzy neuron learning using backfitting algorithm,"This paper proposes an automatic and simple approach to design a neo-fuzzy neuron for identification purposes. The proposed approach uses the backfitting algorithm to learn multiple univariate additive models, where each additive model is a zero-order T-S fuzzy system which is a function of one input variable, and there is one additive model for each input variable. The multiple zero-order T-S fuzzy models constitute a neo-fuzzy neuron. The structure of the model used in this paper allows to have results with good interpretability and accuracy. To validate and demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied on 10 benchmark data sets and compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector regression (SVR) algorithms, and two algorithms for design neo-fuzzy neuron systems, an adaptive learning algorithm for a neo-fuzzy neuron systems (ALNFN), and a fuzzy Kolmogorov’s network (FKN). A statistical paired t test analysis is also presented to compare the proposed approach with ELM, SVR, ALNFN, and FKN with the aim to see whether the results of the proposed approach are statistically different from ELM, SVR, ALNFN, and FKN. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms ELM and FKN in all data sets and outperforms SVR and ALNFN in almost all data sets that they were statistically different in almost all data sets and that in most data sets the number of fuzzy rules selected by cross-validation was small obtaining a model with a small complexity and good interpretability capability."
Parenting in the Context of Childhood Trauma: Self-Efficacy as a Mediator between Attributions and Parenting Competence,"Given the well documented relationship between childhood trauma and the regulation of stress and emotion, it is likely that childhood trauma also will have important implications for parenting. As a result, the current study aimed to understand the relationships among mothers’ attributions, self-efficacy, and parenting competence within the context of childhood trauma experiences. In particular, mothers’ self-efficacy was examined as a mediator in the relationship between attributions and parenting competence. The sample was divided into low and high trauma subsamples. Mediation analyses indicated that, for mothers in the low childhood trauma subsample, the model was not supported. In contrast, among mothers in the high childhood trauma subsample, the model was supported. Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy was a strong unique predictor for young children’s internalizing and externalizing problems in mothers from the low childhood trauma subsample. In contrast, the examined variables worked more collectively in the prediction of young children’s internalizing and externalizing problems for mothers in the high childhood trauma subsample. These findings suggested that mothers’ understanding of their young children’s problems and their own parenting were related differently when the context of childhood trauma experiences was considered and may be important to target in parenting interventions."
"Associations between Stress, Psychosomatic Complaints, and Parental Criticism among Affluent Adolescent Girls","A growing body of research has shown that adolescent girls in the context of affluence face a series of unique pressures that may increase social-emotional problems. Little research, however, has examined associations between perceived stress and psychosomatic complaints among privileged youth. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between stress, psychosomatic complaints, and parental criticism in a sample of preadolescent and adolescent girls (n = 218) from selective, private schools. Using OLS regression analyses, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were evident between perceived stress and psychosomatic complaints, with increases in stress associated with increases in psychosomatic problems. Parental criticism was also examined as a predictor of girls’ psychosomatic complaints and stress levels. Results indicated that parental criticism was significantly and positively associated with psychosomatic problems in cross-sectional models and that perceived stress levels mediated this association. Additional analyses demonstrated that the relationship between psychosomatic complaints and stress may be bidirectional. Taken together, results from this exploratory study suggest that girls in the context of affluence may also experience psychosomatic complaints, in addition to social-emotional problems."
An efficient video watermarking based security model,"Watermarking is defined as about hiding any valuable information set in the particular digital media by itself through modifying the particular graphic contents. In our proposed method, the process of watermarking is performed from video data. In this work group search optimization is used to determine the position, selection for watermarking. The proposed framework includes the following stages particularly, frame conversion, preprocessing, watermark image selection, watermarking position selection and inverse watermarking. Initially, the input video is segregated into a number of frames. Then in preprocessing, both the input and the original image are resized and the original image is transformed by discrete wavelet transform. Then the secret data to be embedded is selected and replaced in the watermark position determined through the Group Search Optimization (GSO) Algorithm. Finally, inverse watermarking is performed to retrieve the secret data. The proposed technique is implemented in the working platform of MATLAB which shows improved results by using GSO as compared to without GSO method."
Hybrid micromolding of silver micro fiber doped electrically conductive elastomeric composite polymer for flexible sensors and electronic devices,"Development of conductive nanocomposites is critical to realize flexible electronics on diverse substrates. Tuning the electrical and mechanical characteristics of these nanocomposites can enable a spectrum of applications. Herein, we demonstrate a robust microfabrication protocol to implement electrically conductive polymer by doping polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with silver fibers, with potential applications in wearable devices, MEMS, and microfluidics. The conductive polymer was made by mixing silver fibers into uncured PDMS matrix. The prepared mixture was micromolded by three dimension (3D) printed master using soft lithography technique. Serpentine and spiral like microstructures were embedded on the nonconductive layer of PDMS. The SEM images show uniform dispersion of silver fibers in the composites. The percolation threshold for the prepared composite was found to be 25 wt%. Resistivity of the conductive elastomeric composite at 25 wt% was 0.013 Ω cm."
"The effects of vitamin E on brain derived neurotrophic factor, tissues oxidative damage and learning and memory of juvenile hypothyroid rats","The effects of vitamin E (Vit E) on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and brain tissues oxidative damage as well as on learning and memory impairments in juvenile hypothyroid rats were examined. The rats were grouped as: (1) Control; (2) Propylthiouracil (PTU); (3) PTU-Vit E and (4) Vit E. PTU was added to their drinking water (0.05%) during 6 weeks. Vit E (20 mg/kg) was daily injected (IP). Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) were carried out. The animals were deeply anesthetized and the brain tissues were removed for biochemical measurements. PTU increased the escape latency and traveled path in MWM (P < 0.001). It also shortened the latency to enter the dark compartment of PA as well as the time spent in the target quadrant in probe trial of MWM (P < 0.01-P < 0.001). All the effects of PTU were reversed by Vit E (P < 0.01-P < 0.001). PTU administration attenuated thiol and BDNF content as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the brain tissues while increased molondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, Vit E improved BDNF, thiol, SOD and CAT while diminished MDA. The results of the present study showed that Vit E improved BDNF and prevented from brain tissues oxidative damage as well as learning and memory impairments in juvenile hypothyroid rats."
Losses of Cr content in plant samples using digestion procedures with acids,"In the WEPAL IPE 2009.2 proficiency test, Jožef Stefan Institute (JSI) participated by measuring Cr by k0-INAA; it was the only laboratory providing data by an instrumental technique. The JSI Cr result was about 38% higher than the assigned value in plant sample 124 (Lucerne/Medicago sativum). The same sample was again studied in 2012. This time, more labs, including JSI, used instrumental techniques and the average Cr result was higher and consistent with the 2009 and 2012 JSI results. From the results obtained in the present study, involving four INAA labs, it is confirmed that Cr losses in this sample occurred during the chemical digestion required by the techniques applied by other laboratories, illustrating the inherent advantage of nuclear techniques to be almost matrix independent and independent of the chemical state of the element under study."
"Poloxamers, poloxamines and polymeric micelles: Definition, structure and therapeutic applications in cancer","Research for new therapies to treat diseases like cancer, it is one of the focus of Health Sciences. Nowadays, the available therapeutic strategies have in many cases limitations and undesired side effects, which shows a need to find new therapies with a higher efficacy. In this regard, over the past few years, poloxamers and poloxamines have been gaining more attention in the pharmaceutical field, mainly due to their advantages as potential nanosystems. Therefore, poloxamers and poloxamines are amphiphilic block of copolymers constituted by PEO units, poly(ethylene oxide), and PPO units, poly(propylene oxide), presenting the capability to self-assembly in micellar structures in aqueous medium forming polymeric micelles, which improve theirs potential as drug and genetic material nanocarriers. Thereby, in order to create new alternative treatments for current pathologies, like cancer, alterations in the poloxamines and poloxamers, the combination of these with other polymers and the conjugation with ligands are being introduced as a viable option to allow the combination of therapies, such as the simultaneous delivery of a gene and a drug in the same system. These intelligent stimuli-sensitive systems, with well-defined structures and functionalities, make possible the development of a safe, specific and effective therapeutic strategy. Thus, this article intends to review several aspects of poloxamines and poloxamers concerning their general properties and their applications in drug and gene delivery. Also, are reviewed the preparation and characterization techniques of polymeric micelles with a focus in micelleplexes which can be used as a simultaneous drug and nucleic acid carrier."
Protective Effects of Selenium on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Oxidative Stress and Kidney Injury,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a common anticancer drug, but its use in cancer treatment is limited due to its severe toxicities induced mainly by oxidative stress in normal cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to multiple organ injuries, including the kidneys. Selenium (Se) is a nutritionally essential trace element with antioxidant properties. In the present study, the possible protective effect of Se on CP-induced acute nephrotoxicity was investigated. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into six groups of seven rats in each. The control group received saline, and other groups were injected with CP (150 mg/kg), Se (0.5 or 1 mg/kg), or CP + Se intraperitoneally. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant state (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), creatinine, and cystatin C (Cys C) levels were measured in the sera. In addition, kidney tissues were examined histologically. In the CP alone treated rats, creatinine, Cys C, TOS, and OSI levels increased, while TAC level decreased. CP-induced histological damages were decreased by co-treatment of Se and biochemical results supported the microscopic observations. In conclusion, our study points to the therapeutic potential of Se and indicates a significant role of ROS in CP-induced kidney toxicity."
Tetrahymena dynamin-related protein 6 self-assembles independent of membrane association,"Self-assembly on target membranes is one of the important properties of all dynamin family proteins. Drp6, a dynamin-related protein in Tetrahymena, controls nuclear remodelling and undergoes cycles of assembly/disassembly on the nuclear envelope. To elucidate the mechanism of Drp6 function, we have characterized its biochemical and biophysical properties using size exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that Drp6 readily forms high-molecular-weight self-assembled structures as determined by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed that Drp6 assembles into rings and spirals at physiological ionic strength. We have also shown that the recombinant Drp6 expressed in bacteria is catalytically active and its GTPase activity is not enhanced by low salt. These results suggest that, in contrast to dynamins but similar to MxA, Drp6 self-assembles in the absence of membrane templates, and its GTPase activity is not affected by ionic strength of the buffer. We discuss the self-assembly structure of Drp6 and explain the basis for lack of membrane-stimulated GTPase activity."
Real Indeterminacy of Stationary Monetary Equilibria in Centralized Economies,"We show that real indeterminacy of stationary equilibria, by which the set of stationary equilibria is a continuum and the real allocation varies among equilibria, may arise in some general equilibrium models with fiat money. The conditions under which such equilibria arise are: (i) each household optimally saves a constant amount of money; and (ii) at least two households face different budget constraints. We present various models, including a decentralized money search model and a centralized model with a monopoly firm, to explain how these conditions lead to real indeterminacy. Finally, we present a policy that uniquely implements any desirable outcome."
The Dynamic Relationship Between Corruption—Inflation: Evidence from Panel Vector Autoregression,"This paper aims to explain the mixed causality nexus between corruption and inflation. For that, we apply a panel vector autoregression model on a large sample of 180 countries over the period 1996–2014. Using two corruption indexes and subsample estimations, results provide evidence that the inflation—corruption nexus is bidirectional. The causal effect is more important from corruption to inflation. Interactions remain significant but heterogeneous across subsamples with different income levels. The corruption effect is persistent only in low—middle income economies and its adverse effect on inflation is weaker in high-income economies. The two-way relationship between inflation and corruption reflects the inability to control inflation and the situation of the poverty trap in some countries."
Immigrants’ Transnational Entrepreneurial Activities: the Case of Ghanaian Immigrants in Canada,"Immigrant entrepreneurship comes in two forms: domestic and transnational entrepreneurship. Domestic immigrant entrepreneurs depend on the host society for business success while transnational immigrant entrepreneurs depend on the contacts and partners in their countries of origin and other countries. In recent years, immigrants’ entrepreneurial activity has moved from the domestic to the transnational level because of the simultaneous business activities that such entrepreneurs conduct between their home and host countries. Transnational entrepreneurship has become one of the pathways that immigrants use to settle and integrate into the host society’s labor market, and at the same time contribute to their countries of origin. From this perspective, this paper explores the causes, nature, and practices of transnational entrepreneurial activities of Ghanaian immigrants in Canada. Using in-depth interviews and focus groups, the study finds that transnational entrepreneurship has become an essential strategy among Ghanaian immigrant entrepreneurs due to the large and growing number of immigrant communities and demand for ethnic products and services that are not produced in Canada. The study also finds that transnational entrepreneurship has become an avenue for immigrants to connect and create ties with Ghana and contribute to its economic development."
Latina Mothers’ Involvement in an HIV/STI and Substance Use Prevention Program for Adolescents: A Parallel Intervention Curriculum,"As part of a larger HIV/STI/Substance Abuse Prevention intervention targeted to middle school students, we offered students’ parents an opportunity to participate in an adult education class. The same curricular materials were used for students enrolled in the intervention and for their parents. In the current study, mothers who had completed the adult education class participated in a focus group. The focus group explored what components of the intervention were perceived by mothers as particularly useful to them or to their child. Three core themes emerged from interpretive analyses of the focus group: (1) positive relationships with intervention staff and school personnel enticed students to participate in the intervention and facilitated parents’ involvement; (2) both students and parents felt respected and empowered by the intervention’s cornerstone values and curricular philosophy of cultural richness and pride in Hispanic/Latino heritage; and (3) mothers perceived their mastery of the course content—materially wholly dedicated to the health and wellness of their children—benefitted them in terms of both understanding the material and potentially allowing mothers to discuss health-oriented behavior with their young adolescent child."
1/f Noise modeling of InAs/GaSb superlattice mid-wavelength infrared detectors,"The empirical 1/f noise model for p\(^{+}\)-p-n infrared detector made of type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice material is presented. It is shown that 1/f noise magnitude can be accurately estimated if dark current contributions are determined and noise coefficients are known. It is found that the shunt, the bulk generation–recombination, and the trap-assisted tunneling currents contribute to the total 1/f noise. No 1/f noise connected with the diffusion and the band-to-band tunneling currents is observed."
Quantitative characterization of TiO2 nanoparticle release from textiles by conventional and single particle ICP-MS,"TiO2 is ubiquitously present in a wide range of everyday items, both as an intentionally incorporated additive and naturally occurring constituent. It can be found in a wide range of consumer products, including personal care products, food contact materials, and textiles. Normal use of these products may lead to consumer and/or environmental exposure to TiO2, possibly in form of nanoparticles. The aim of this study is to perform a leaching test and apply state-of-the-art methods to investigate nano-TiO2 and total Ti release from five types of commercially available conventional textiles: table placemats, wet wipes, microfiber cloths, and two types of baby bodysuits, with Ti contents ranging from 2.63 to 1448 μg/g. Released particle analysis was performed using conventional and single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS and spICP-MS), in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to measure total and particulate TiO2 release by mass and particle number, as well as size distribution. Less than 1% of the initial Ti content was released over 24 h of leaching, with the highest releases reaching 3.13 μg/g. The fraction of nano-TiO2 released varied among fabric types and represented 0–80% of total TiO2 release. Particle mode sizes were 50–75 nm, and TEM imaging revealed particles in sizes of 80–200 nm. This study highlights the importance of using a multi-method approach to obtain quantitative release data that is able to provide an indication regarding particle number, size distribution, and mass concentration, all of which can help in understanding the fate and exposure of nanoparticles."
Preterm Delivery as a Unique Pathophysiologic State Characterized by Maternal Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase 1 and Uterine Artery Resistance During Pregnancy: A Longitudinal Cohort Study,"Background: Preterm delivery (PTD) may be characterized by altered interrelationships among angiogenic factors and measures of placental function. We analyzed the longitudinal relationship between maternal serum concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (sFltI), an important antiangiogenic factor, and uterine artery resistance in pregnancies resulting in preterm and term deliveries. Methods: Data were collected in a longitudinal cohort study involving 278 women monitored at 6 to 10, 10 to 14, 16 to 20, 22 to 26, and 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. Concentrations of maternal serum sFltI were determined using solidphase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and uterine artery resistance indices (RI) were measured by Doppler velocimetry at each interval. Preterm delivery was defined as birth before 37-weeks completed gestation. Data analyses used multivariable repeated measures regression models. Results: Uterine artery RI decreased across gestation. As pregnancy progressed, RI trajectories diverged for term and preterm deliveries; the mean RI was significantly higher in third trimester for pregnancies resulting in PTD (P = .08). sFltI was stable through 21 3/7 weeks of gestation and then increased rapidly; women who delivered preterm had significantly higher sFltI levels in the third trimester (P =.04). The relationship between uterine artery RI and sFltI from the prior visit was significantly different between the groups (P < .0001). For term deliveries, higher sFltI concentrations were associated with a smaller RI at the subsequent visit (β = −.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.14 to −0.02). For PTD, higher sFltI concentrations were associated with a larger uterine artery RI (β = .14, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.22). Conclusion: PTD is characterized by altered relationships between angiogenic factors and placental vascular blood flow starting in early pregnancy."
Quantum tomography for collider physics: illustrations with lepton-pair production,"Quantum tomography is a method to experimentally extract all that is observable about a quantum mechanical system. We introduce quantum tomography to collider physics with the illustration of the angular distribution of lepton pairs. The tomographic method bypasses much of the field-theoretic formalism to concentrate on what can be observed with experimental data. We provide a practical, experimentally driven guide to model-independent analysis using density matrices at every step. Comparison with traditional methods of analyzing angular correlations of inclusive reactions finds many advantages in the tomographic method, which include manifest Lorentz covariance, direct incorporation of positivity constraints, exhaustively complete polarization information, and new invariants free from frame conventions. For example, experimental data can determine the entanglement entropy of the production process. We give reproducible numerical examples and provide a supplemental standalone computer code that implements the procedure. We also highlight a property of complex positivity that guarantees in a least-squares type fit that a local minimum of a \(\chi ^{2}\) statistic will be a global minimum: There are no isolated local minima. This property with an automated implementation of positivity promises to mitigate issues relating to multiple minima and convention dependence that have been problematic in previous work on angular distributions."
Revealed individual attendance at Italian theatre: a microeconomic investigation,"This paper investigates theatre consumption in Italy in 3 years, 1995, 2000 and 2006 using data provided by the Italian Institute of Statistics (2006 the latest year for such data) and the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers. These data sets are very large and rarely analysed in the current economic literature. Explanatory variables are determined by identifying their contributions to both the probability to attend, and the probability to attend more, using the finite mixture regression model. Socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, participation in other cultural activities, ticket price and theatre supply are taken into account to varying extents. Three main findings emerge based on a more generous sample than past analyses. The strong confirmation of a priori expectations for education and occupation variables. The different impact of explanatory variables on the decision to attend and the decision to attend more. Finally, a remarkable consistency of results across the 3 year surveys and the different model specifications."
A Comparative Study of RMI and ROMA in Women Presenting with an Adnexal Mass,"Differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms is essential to create a system for patient referrals. Therefore, tumor markers such as CA-125 and human epididymis protein 4 (HE-4) as well as the risk ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) and risk malignancy index (RMI) values were considered individually and in combination to evaluate their utility in referral of women at a high risk of having an ovarian malignancy to cancer centers where multidisciplinary input is available."
Leaf periderm supports longevity and functionality of crown leaves in Agathis species (Araucariaceae),"Periderm of the leaves of two Agathis species was studied. Agathis leaves are long-lived and remain alive for more than 25 years. Periderm occurs regularly and can be initiated in the epidermis, mesophyll, phloem parenchyma of the leaf veins and in the ground tissue of the petiole. Periderm lies on the surface, is located in the mesophyll or splits it. Periderm structure is either typical, consisting of phellogen, multilayered phellem and phelloderm or disordered. Agathis leaves are able to form true wound periderm, which has been shown experimentally. We believe that at least some of the factors inducing periderm initiation are identical both in leaves and in stems. Mechanical tension in the tissues and cell deformation plays an essential role in the periderm initiation. Leaf tissues isolated due to the suberinization process may function as a storage site for the substances not involved in the plant metabolism or excluded from it. Periderm gives an opportunity to keep such substances away from functional tissues, which is important for evergreen plants with long-lived leaves."
Chronotype and sleep duration are associated with stimulant consumption and BMI among Chinese undergraduates,"The study sought to identify the association between stimulant consumption and social jetlag, chronotype as well as sleep duration among undergraduate students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the university town in Chongqing, China. Data were collected on 977 participants, age 20.06 (SD = 1.25) years old, using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) to measure social jetlag, chronotype and average sleep duration. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect the information: BMI, demographic data, outdoor activity time, smoking status, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. The positive significant association was found between late chronotype and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.05–1.52]), being a current smoker (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.26–2.07]) and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (OR = 1.42, 95% CI [1.17–1.72]). Average sleep duration was negatively associated with BMI (OR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.71–0.98]). Social jetlag did not find any association between stimulant consumption and BMI in the adjusted model. The results showed that Chinese undergraduate students had a negative significant association between average sleep duration and BMI, and late chronotype might affect the stimulant consumption among the group. This study may provide some implications for health management of obesity among undergraduate students in China."
Providing tool support for specifying safety-critical systems by enforcing syntactic contract conditions,"Functional safety standards such as IEC 61508 and ISO 26262 advocate a particularly stringent requirements engineering where safety requirements must be structured in a hierarchical manner and specified in accordance with the system architecture. In contrast to the stringent requirements engineering in functional safety standards, according to previous studies, requirements engineering in industry is in general of poor quality. Contracts theory has been previously shown to be suitable for supporting such a stringent requirements engineering effort; this support has also been implemented in tools. However, to use these contract-based tools, requirements must be formalized, which is a major challenge in industry. Therefore, to support current industrial requirements engineering practice and the stringent requirements engineering in functional safety standards, it is shown how tool support can be provided even when requirements, and also architectures, are not formalized. This is achieved by enforcing syntactic, yet formal, conditions in contracts theory. Despite the need for further validation, initial findings in an industrial case study indicate high potential in realizing the proposed support in an industrial setting."
The pH-dependent activation mechanism of Ser102 in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase: a theoretical study,"The accepted catalytic mechanism of alkaline phosphatases was established on the hypothesis that Mg-coordinated water is a readily available hydroxide ion that functions as a general base and accepts a proton from the Ser102 hydroxyl group. The roles of the two distinctive residues Asp153 and Lys328 in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (ECAP),  which distinguish it from the mammalian enzymes, are elusive. Based on the crystal structures of ECAP in the absence and presence of inorganic phosphate, we have investigated the activation of Ser102 for nucleophilic attack and the subsequent formation of a covalent phosphoseryl intermediate using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional. Our calculations confirmed a proton transfer path from the hydroxyl group of Ser102 to the carboxyl group of Asp153 via water-mediated interactions through which Ser102 can be activated for nucleophilic attack. Our calculations further suggest that the activation mechanism of Ser102 is pH dependent, which explains why ECAP achieves its maximum activity at an alkaline pH for enzyme-catalysed reactions. This activation mechanism can also be extended to all APs with similar active-site structures. Our study, for the first time, provides the definite activation mechanism of Ser102 in ECAP, which is universal for all APs and explains the alkaline phosphatase activity of these enzymes. This work also sheds new light on the relationship between enzyme-catalytic mechanisms and enzyme-catalytic properties."
Deformation analysis and error prediction in machining of thin-walled honeycomb-core sandwich structural parts,"Due to its low rigidity and poor stiffness, machining deformation in numerical control milling is a big obstacle to achieve accurate shape of thin-walled honeycomb-core sandwich structural parts. In this paper, the factors which affect the machining deformation of these structural parts are analyzed at first. Then, a finite element analysis model is established, which considers the affecting factors of workpiece original stress, fixture constraints and cutting forces, to simulate the magnitude and distribution of the machining deformation. Afterwards, a prediction model is developed by using back propagation neural network to build the relationship between the deformation and machining parameters. Finally, the milling and measurement experiments are performed to validate the proposed prediction model. By comparing the experimental result with the simulation result and the prediction result, it is found that the experimental result was 7.2 and 2.2% less than the simulation result and the prediction result, respectively. Thus, a conclusion is drawn that the machining deformation prediction methodology is feasible."
A fuzzy logic-based model in laser-assisted bending springback control,"The present investigation deals with the proposal of a fuzzy model able to describe the inherent uncertainties related to manufacturing processes and is applied to a laser-assisted bending process. The use of such a model is aimed at controlling of the springback phenomena, which occurs during the hybrid forming process, for different set of laser process parameters, i.e., initial deflection, laser power, laser scan speed, and number of passes. In particular, the uncertainties are propagated to the residual springback by the General Transformation Method, providing only an input-output relation. The fuzzy results are then compared with the measured data leading to the evaluation of the membership level of the dataset to the uncertain model. The process maps obtained are used to select operational parameters in order to obtain a desired process output, providing as additional information how much the uncertainty of the model and the process varies by changing those operational parameters. The large variability of the process is highlighted by the fuzzy model through large band of uncertainty that occur in all the process maps generated. The fuzzy model has also been used to assess the optimal parameters in order to satisfy the requirement of the least-cost. In this case, it resulted to be convenient reduce the number of passes and use the highest laser power."
How Apis mellifera Behaves with its Invasive Hornet Predator Vespa velutina?,"Invasive species are now recognized as a major cause of native biodiversity loss worldwide. In the current deleterious context for pollinators, the invasive yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, represents an additional threat to the domestic honeybee, Apis mellifera, in Europe. Therefore, understanding the impact of this predator on honeybee colonies is of major importance. In the present study, we tried to assess the impact of V. velutina on the honeybee foraging and defence behaviour based on the video monitoring of two hives. Balling behaviour is reported here for the first time under natural conditions in A. mellifera against V. velutina in Europe. Although these results are preliminary and should be carefully considered, we found that the number of hornets impacted honeybee foraging and defence behaviours. More defensive behaviours were notified in the hive, which survives slightly longer. This may suggest that selecting for more defensive colonies may provide an interesting perspective."
Tree species richness in northeastern China: geographical variation and minimum areas,"The geographical patterns of tree species richness in forest communities have been studied widely, but little is known about the geographical variation of the estimated species richness and minimum areas using species-area curves. A differential technique based on the species-area relationships (SAR) was developed for estimating the minimum area (Amin) capturing 60–80% of the species in each plot, which is an important characteristic of a forest community. The relationship between estimated species richness (ESR) from the SAR and the corresponding minimum area is described by the linear model ESR = 0.0051×Amin (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001). Both the ESR and the minimum area exhibit similar geographical variations with a significant increase along altitudinal and a decrease along latitudinal gradients. The spatial variations of the ESR were partitioned into three geographical components and their combined effects. Altitude accounted for 40% and 45% of the total variation in the ESR and the minimum area, respectively. While latitude accounted for 69% and 61% of the total variation in the ESR and the minimum area, respectively. Thus, latitude is the main determinant which influences the geographical variation of the ESR. As far as we know, this study presents the first report of the geographical patterns of the minimum area in temperate forests."
Phytophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) as indicators of changing landscapes,"Spatial and temporal differences in landscape patterns are of considerable interest for understanding ecological processes. In this study, we assessed habitat quality by using the Syrph The Net database and data on decreasing species richness over a 25-year period for the two largest phytophagous hoverfly genera (Merodon and Cheilosia). Furthermore, within this time frame, we explored congruence between ecological responses (species richness and Biodiversity Maintenance Function for these two genera) and landscape structural changes through correlation analysis. Our results indicate that landscapes have experienced changes in aggregation, isolation/connectivity and landscape diversity, with these parameters being significantly correlated with Cheilosia species richness loss and habitat quality. We conclude that the genus Cheilosia is a good bioindicator that can highlight not only the current quality of an area but also temporal changes in landscape patterns."
Sex-specific interaction of body condition and asymmetry in carabids in distinct urbanisation stages,"Physiological condition of an animal is flexible and can quickly change in relation to the quality of its environment. This makes it potentially suitable as an estimator of environmental stress. We studied the condition in three predatory ground beetles, Carabus nemoralis, Nebria brevicollis and Pterostichus melanarius along an urbanisation gradient (forest-suburban area - forest fragments in urban park) in Sorø, Denmark to test whether urbanisation-related stress is reflected in body condition. We also considered the interaction between condition and the true asymmetry using a local polynomial regression model. Females showed consistently better condition than males in all studied species. The condition indices in C. nemoralis and N. brevicollis were higher in the urban habitats than the other sites, while P. melanarius showed better condition in the suburban forest fragments than the forest or urban habitats. A significant negative correlation was found between condition and asymmetry for C. nemoralis and N. brevicollis in the suburban as well as urban forest fragments. This indicates a complex interaction between tolerance limits, feeding conditions and stress levels during advancing urbanisation, emphasising the importance of using multiple criteria for assessing its impact on biodiversity."
Factors shaping species richness and biodiversity of riverine macroinvertebrate assemblages at the local and regional scale,"The biodiversity and species richness of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are under the strong pressure of environmental variables compounded with geographical and historical processes. Numerous studies that have investigated biodiversity and assemblage stability have shown the importance of choosing proper methodologies and paradigms. Consequently, the use of diversity measures and the partitioning of biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales are of particular significance. Within habitats, only those species whose preferences remain within a tolerable range of the variability of abiotic factors are able to survive. The structure of biocoenosis at the local scale is determined mainly by current velocity/discharge, granulometry of the inorganic bottom substrate, quantity and quality of particulate organic matter, as well as water quality variables. Dispersion plays a key role in shaping regional diversity gradients, which supports the permanent inflow of individuals and their exchange between riverine basins. However, dispersion is also one of the basic aspects of the saturation/non-saturation of local communities with species from the regional species pool; a respective concept tries to determine how, why and to what degree local species richness is dependent on regional species richness."
Electro-Antennographic Response of Helopeltis theivora to Synthetic Pesticides Used in Tea Plantations,Helopeltis theivora is considered as one of the major pest in tea plantations causing considerable economic damage. Recent control strategies against this notorious polyphagous pest mainly depend on the application of insecticides. The study is focused on the antennal response of H. theivora on exposure to different insecticides using electroantenogram (EAG). The result showed that the insects perceive quinalphos as they are frequently exposed to it. The hierarchy of the EAG response of exposed and unexposed insects was quinalphos > bifenthrin > deltamethrin > thiamethoxam.
Salinity Tolerance of Grafted Watermelon Seedlings,"In order to evaluate the salinity tolerance of grafted watermelon, two sets of experiments were conducted in a growing chamber where ‘Esmeralda’ varieties were grafted onto interspecific squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch. × Cucurbita moschata Duch.) and Lagenaria siceraria rootstocks. Both non-grafted and self-garfted plants were used for control. For salt stress, 2.85 and 4.28 mM/l substrate doses of NaCl were added with each irrigation in 2 day intervals for a duration of 23 days. Interspecific-grafted plants showed the highest salinity tolerance as plant biomass and leaf area were not decreased but improved by salinity in most cases. Furthermore, transpiration and photosynthesis activity did not decrease as much as it did in the case of other grafting combinations. Interspecific and Lagenaria rootstocks showed sodium retention, as elevation of Na+ content in the leaves of these grafting combinations was negligible compared to self-grafted and non-grafted ones. Presumably abiotic stress tolerance can be enhanced by grafting per se considering measured parameters of self-grafted plants did not decrease as much as seen in non-grafted ones."
Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Oxidative Damage on Mechanical Properties of the Articular Cartilage,"Articular cartilage has unique mechanical and physicochemical properties which are responsible for its load carrying capabilities. This work investigates the effects of hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage on mechanical properties of articular cartilage. Bovine articular cartilage was exposed to hydrogen peroxide for a week. Dynamic and static mechanical tests applied to calculate articular cartilage compressive modulus. We observed higher control curve slopes than that of hydrogen peroxide curves which account for lesser stiffness values in the exposed articular cartilage. For the instantaneous experiments, results were statistically significant (p = 0.01, p > 0.05). Here report that hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage causes reduction in the stiffness of the articular cartilage."
Establishment of an Efficient Plant Regeneration Culture Protocol and Achievement of Successful Genetic Transformation in Jatropha curcas L.,"An efficient and reproducible protocol is described for shoot-bud regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of J. curcas. Treating the explants with high concentrations (5–120 mg/L) of TDZ for short durations (5–80 min) before inoculation culture increased significantly the regeneration frequency and improved the quality of the regenerated buds. The highest shoot-buds induction rate (87.35%) was achieved when petiole explants were treated with 20 mg/L TDZ solution for 20 min and inoculated on hormone-free MS medium for 30 days. Regenerated shoots of 0.5 cm or a little longer were isolated and grafted to seedling stocks of the same species, and then the grafted plantlets were planted on half-strength MS medium containing 0.1 mg/L IBA and 2 mg/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP). This grafting strategy was found to be very effective, to obtain that healthy grafted plantlets ready for acclimatization within 20 days. By the above mentioned protocol and with general Agrobacterium–mediated genetic transformation methods only 65 days were needed to obtain intact transgenic plants."
"Quantitative Evaluation of Boerhavia diffusa and Its Commercial Formulations with Respect to Its Major Bioactive Marker, Eupalitin Galactoside, Using High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography","In view of extensive applications in the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine and the increased demand for both as single ingredient and as a major component in multiherbal formulations of Boerhavia diffusa, a rapid, sensitive and reproducible high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method has been developed for its quantitative evaluation with respect to its major bio-active marker, eupalitin galactoside. For the separation of the marker compound, HPTLC silica gel F254 pre-coated plates were used with n-butanol—acetic acid—water (8:1:1) as the mobile phase. The method was validated for limit of detection, limit of quantifi-cation, linearity, specifcity, precession, and recovery. The results indicate that the bio-active marker was present in 0.075% in B. diffusa whole plant. Surprisingly, the marker compound could not be detected even in traces in two of the B. diffusa commercial formulations such as punarnava mandur and artin capsules, which contain more than ten herbal and herbo-mineral ingredients. This might be due to the loss of the marker compound during their manufacturing process or diferent plant parts used in the two test samples. The developed method can be used successfully for the quality control and quality assurance of B. diffusa formulations, where the whole plant is used."
"Qualitative and Quantitative Characterization of Two Licorice Root Species (Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) by HPTLC, Validated by HPLC and DNA Sequencing","The herbal drug licorice root may be derived from the plant species Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, and/or Glycyr-rhiza inflata Bat. which are morphologically, chemically, pharmacologically, and toxicologically similar. However, if an ingredient of a dietary supplement is identified as a certain species and labeled as such on the product, appropriate analytical methodologies are required to assure the authenticity. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), we were able to distinguish clearly between G. glabra and G. uralensis, the most commonly used species, which allowed us to check the corresponding label claims of twenty-six dietary supplements. Two samples of G. inflata Bat, which were available for the study, were not distinguished from G. glabra by this method. Our investigation revealed that five of the twenty-eight samples made a wrong label claim. The HPTLC results were confirmed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding. For the quantitative analysis of the marker 18β-glycyrrhizic acid in licorice root, we modified our HPTLC method for base-line separation of the peaks which guaranteed accurate results. Moreover, the new method is also capable to identify and distinguish both species of licorice. The quantitative HPTLC results were in accordance with the data obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) method on licorice root. In addition, we used two DNA candidate barcodes (internal transcribed spacer [ITS] and psbA—trnH inter-genic spacer) for species identification."
"Greener Thin-Layer Chromatographic Solvents for the Determination of Pantoprazole Sodium Sesquihydrate, Metronidazole and Clarithromycin in Pharmaceutical Formulations Used as Triple Therapy in Helicobacter Infection","A selective densitometric analysis has been adopted for the determination of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, metronidazole, and clarithromycin as they play an important rule as co-administrated drugs in the treatment of helicobacter infection. The aim of this work was to fid greener thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) solvents to follow the environmental safety measurements. The three drugs are vastly diferent in chemical structure, so it was very challenging to carry out the simultaneous separation and quanti-tation by TLC technique at RFvalues 0.49 ± 0.01, 0.72 ± 0.01, and 0.83 ± 0.01, respectively. In the developed method, chromatogra-phy was performed on TLC plates with pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 using ethyl acetate and absolute ethanol (3:1)—heptane—ammonia 33% (14:5:1, v/v) as the developing system with calculated polarity (3.535). Densitometric measurements were carried out using CAMAG Linomat 5 TLC scanner at 280 nm. Regression line data were evaluated by the least square method within the concentration range of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, metronidazole, and clarithromycin 0.8–8, 4–40, and 5–50 µg band-1, and the detection limits of the drugs were 0.15, 0.76, and 0.88 µg band-1, respectively. The suitability of this TLC method for the quantity determination of three compounds in drug substances and drug products was proved by validation in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines (Q2R1). Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t and F test, revealing no signifcant diference between the TLC method and the ofcial ones concerning accuracy and precision."
Simultaneous Determination of Chlorogenic and Caffeic Acid in Siegesbeckia orientalis L. (Xi Xian) by a Validated High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatographic Method,"Secondary metabolites are an integral part of the plant kingdom which plays a vital role in development, growth, and defense. These are also very helpful for humans against different disorders. Phenols due to their strong antioxidant activity have a central role in conferring different types of biological activities. The present study aims at the simultaneous determination of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in the methanolic extracts of leaf samples of Siegesbeckia orientalis L. Simultaneous elution of both compounds has been attained by using toluene—ethyl acetate—formic acid-methanol (6:6:1.6:0.6 v/v) as the mobile phase, and densitometric evaluation was done at 366 nm. The linear regression data for the calibration curve of both compounds show good linear relationship in the concentration range of 200–600 ng. The proposed method has been validated in terms of limit of detection, limit of quantification, specificity, precision, and accuracy studies. The present high-performance thin-layer chromatographic method has been applied for the quantification of both compounds in the various accessions of S. orientalis collected from different localities of North India. Maximum amount of chlorogenic acid was found in the Taluka accession, while caffeic acid was found in the Rarhi accession collected from Uttarakhand state."
Separation and Quantification of Phenolic Metabolites Using Thin-Layer Chromatography Followed by Ultraviolet—Visible Spectroscopy: Urinary Biomarkers of Benzene Exposure,"Benzene is an omnipresent liquid in industries. The occupational exposure to benzene leads to the urinary excretion of benzene metabolites, viz., phenol, pyrocatechol, hydroquinone, and trihy-droxybenzene, due to its biotransformation. These metabolites are phenolic in nature and considered as immediate biomarkers of benzene exposure. The present work includes the separation and determination of urinary phenolic benzene metabolites by coupling two diferent techniques. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used as the separation technique to get individually separated spots of all four metabolites, which were further quantified by ultraviolet (UV)—visible spectroscopy at 765 nm. For the development of the separated spots on TLC plate and determination of metabolites by UV—visible spectroscopic method, alkaline Folin—Ciocalteau reagent was used. Folin—Ciocalteau reagent is having wide applications for phenol determination and gives blue color with almost all types of phenols. The colored solutions were measured against the blank disk taken from the developed spots on plastic TLC plate. Based on the obtained results, a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the quantitation of urinary phenolic benzene metabolites has been developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The validated method was efcaciously applied to cigarette smokers and petrol station workers, and it was found that the method has favorable application in the routine analysis of urine samples of benzene-exposed population."
Photoperiod and male-presence effects on the onset of reproduction of Porcellio laevis (Oniscidea),"A laboratory survey was done to study both day length and male effect on the reproduction of Porcellio laevis Latreille, 1804. Specimens were maintained in six climatic chambers at different photoperiods [Light:Dark (LD) 0:24, 4:20, 8: 16, 12: 12, 14: 10, 16: 8 and 24: 0] at constant temperature of 20 ± 1°C. The characterization of photoperiodic induction on the onset of reproduction in P. laevis females showed that those maintained under LD 16:8 started reproduction after a delay of 50.27 ± 5.56 days and can perform up to four successive parturial moults. However, females maintained under constant darkness entered in reproduction after 136 ± 5.50 days and underwent only one parturial moult. To evaluate the male-effect on the onset of reproduction, different experiments were conducted highlighting that male presence speeds up the lag-time of females maintained at LD 16:8. We can conclude that long photophases, especially LD 16:8, and male presence stimulate the onset of reproduction."
"Cloning and characterization of Agp1, the gene encoding the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from wheat and its relatives","ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) consists of two large (AGP-L) and two small (AGP-S) subunits; it regulates the limiting step in the biosynthesis of starch. Here, we isolated the full-length cDNA sequence of the AGP-S gene (designed as Agp1) from wheat and whole genomic sequences from relatives of wheat. The coding region of Agp1 ranged from 5948 bp to 7666 bp and contained 9 exons and 8 introns. The full-length cDNA sequence of Agp1 encoded a polypeptide containing 473 amino acids without transit peptides. The sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that the Agp1 cDNA sequence was highly conserved (99.7%) across the diploid Triticeae species examined in this study. Variations in introns caused the Agp1 genomic sequences from wheat relatives to be less similar (79.5%), and Agp1 sequences from the B genome donor species were divergent. In developing grains, rapid increase in Agp1 expression at prophase was closely followed by the accumulation of starch, and a significant (P < 0.001) correlation was observed between them. The heterogeneous mixtures of small and large subunits from different wheat species restarted glycogen synthesis in the Escherichia coli AC70R1-504 cells, which are deficient in endogenous AGP activity (glg C-/-). Our data provide useful information to evaluate and utilize Agp1 sequences in Triticeae species."
Changes by cadmium stress in lipid peroxidation and activities of lipoxygenase and antioxidant enzymes in Arabidopsis are associated with extracellular ATP,"Exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to cadmium (Cd) stress led to an increase in the level of extracellular ATP (eATP). And, Cd stress also caused significant increases in lipid peroxidation and the activities of lipoxygenase (LOX) and antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), and catalase (CAT). Treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5’-triphosphate (AMP-PCP), which serves as a competitive inhibitor of eATP, dampened the Cd-induced increases of lipid peroxidation and the activities of LOX and antioxidant enzymes. Under Cd stress, the leaves of dorn 1–3 mutant showed lower levels of lipid peroxidation and activities of LOX and antioxidant enzymes compared with those of wild type plants. These results suggest that the changes in lipid peroxidation and activities of LOX and antioxidant enzymes under Cd stress could be associated with eATP."
The specific long spike burst pattern indicates the presence of regional variability in the ovine gallbladder motor function,"The myoelectrical activity of ovine gallbladder is incompletely recognized. Accordingly, each of five rams was fitted with six small intestinal and three gallbladder electrodes. The strain gauge force transducer was also mounted near the gallbladder fundic electrode. In two series of chronic experiments the electromyographical and mechanical recordings were conducted during 5–7 h in fasted or non-fasted animals, with or without feeding. The occurrence of the slow waves in the small bowel was common, unlike those in the gallbladder. In the small bowel myoelectrical records both the migrating motility complex and minute rhythm pattern were observed regularly. In the gallbladder, both the migrating motility complex-like activity and the minute rhythm were also denoted in the same time as in the small bowel. In gallbladder infundibulum, and often also in the gallbladder corpus, the specific pattern, called the long spike burst pattern (LSBP) was observed. It comprised usually one or two parts of prolonged duration. The first part resembled the classical (short lasting) spike burst in the small bowel and its amplitude was lower than that of the second part. The spike burst frequency of the second part of the pattern was 2–3 times lower than that of the first part. During phase 1 — and phase 2a-like activity, the frequency of the gallbladder LSBP was reduced in fasted rams. The LSBP amplitude was relatively high and not further enhanced after feeding. In fasted rams, the duration of specific pattern, observed in gallbladder infundibulum, was longer than that in non-fasted animals and its amplitude was low. Similar events were recorded in the gallbladder corpus, but the LSBP was shorter and not regular. In the gallbladder fundus, mostly irregular short spike bursts were recorded. It is concluded that in sheep, specific types of the long-lasting groups of spikes occur in the upper gallbladder areas forming the specific pattern that indicates the presence of the regional variability of the gallbladder motor activity. The character of LSBP depends mostly on feeding conditions."
Optimization of the biosynthesis of naphthoquinones by endophytic fungi isolated of Ferocactus latispinus,"The aim of this work was the isolation of endophytic cacti fungi producer of pigments. Twenty different endophytic fungi were isolated from Ferocactus latispinus using a standard method. One of these was an orange pigment producer and was identified with molecular biology techniques amplifying internal transcribe spacer region. The fungus identified was Fusarium solani; it is a producer of polyketides from naphthoquinones family. Experiments with different carbon and nitrogen sources were performed, and it was found that both glycerol and ammonia sulphate promote the naphthoquinones biosynthesis. It was also found that the carbon/nitrogen ratio and pH value had an effect on this biosynthesis phenomenon; increasing productivity being observed at the initial C: N ratio of 59.6, pH 6 and time of 113.3 h. This C: N ratio exhibited a stress condition for fungi in the pigment biosynthesis process in liquid media. The optimum value of total naphthoquinones (476 μmol/L) was obtained using a central rotable composite design."
Evaluation of an Intervention Program for Families with Children at Risk for Maltreatment and Developmental Impairment: A Preliminary Study,"This study evaluated the preliminary effects of an early intervention program for parents and children at-risk. In this study, a sample of 40 children were randomly assigned to a 9-months intervention program (intervention group, n = 20) or remained in usual practice conditions (control group, n = 20). The intervention involved group dynamics with children in pre-school and individual work sessions with the parents and the children at home. A repeated measures design 2 × 2 was used to test the program effects on parenting practices (Maltreatment Questionnaire) and on children’s mental and social development (Griffiths Mental Development Scales). Results revealed that the program had a positive impact mostly on parenting practices, decreasing physical and psychological abuse (d = −1.01), physical neglect (d = −0.71) and lack of supervision (d = −0.48), and also on measures of cognitive development (i.e., hearing and language; d = 0.31). The program reinforces the importance and effectiveness of attunement intervention programs for parents and for children."
A Randomized Micro-trial of a Loving-Kindness Meditation to Help Parents Respond to Difficult Child Behavior Vignettes,"Loving-kindness meditations (LKM) have not been examined within a parenting context, which is surprising given that LKM helps to build social relationships and connectedness through promoting caring pro-social behavior. This study examined the effects of LKM in a parenting context, using a fifteen-minute audio-guided LKM. In a group-based design micro trial, a total of 61 parents (50 female, mean age = 38.41 years, SD = 6.11) were randomly assigned to receive a LKM or a matched control focused imagery (FI) exercise. Participants completed a series of measures that examined compassion, parenting and child behavior, and parent’s emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses to a set of six hypothetical vignettes describing difficult child behavior. We also assessed for parents’ acceptability towards LKM as a strategy. As predicted, parents who received LKM displayed higher levels of self-compassion and motivation to show themselves compassion compared to the control group; however not compassion towards others. Parents in the LKM compared to the FI group also had more positive (e.g., calm and sympathetic) and less negative emotional (e.g., frustration and anger) responses to the situations of childhood distress; however, parent’s cognitive and behavioral responses did not significantly change. Parent’s also found LKM to be highly acceptable, with 60% indicating they would complete it weekly. The present findings suggest that LKM might be a valuable component to include in evidence-based parenting interventions."
"Prediction of Half-Metallic Properties in Non-transition Metal-based Binary Compounds X Bi (X = Ba, Sr and Ca) with Zinc-Blende and Wurtzite Structures","In this study, structural, electronic and magnetic properties of non-transition metal-based binary compounds X Bi (X = Ba, Sr and Ca) in five different phases: rock salt, NiAs, wurtzite, zinc blende and CsCl, are investigated in order to find new sp magnetic materials used for real spintronic and other related applications. The calculations are performed by a developed full-potential augmented plane wave plus local orbitals (FP-L/APW + lo) method within the spin density functional theory. As exchange-correlation potential, we used the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) and the modified Becke-Johnson potential mBJ-GGA-PBE form. It is found that the magnetic moment in these compounds is mainly contributed by the spin-polarized p orbitals of Bi atoms. The WZ XBi are true half-metallic ferromagnet with opposite spin direction at Fermi energy having a magnetic moment of 2.00 μ B per formula unit."
"Effect of genetic sources on anatomical, morphological, and mechanical properties of 14-year-old genetically improved loblolly pine families from two sites in the southern United States","Tree improvement programs on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) in the southeastern USA has focused primarily on improving growth, form, and disease tolerance. However, due to the recent reduction of design values for visually graded southern yellow pine lumber (including loblolly pine), attention has been drawn to the material quality of genetically improved loblolly pine. In this study, we used the time-of-flight (TOF) acoustic tool to assess the effect of genetic families on diameter, slenderness, fiber length, microfibril angle (MFA), velocity and dynamic stiffness estimated using green density (DMOEG) and basic density (DMOEB) of 14-year-old loblolly pine stands selected from two sites. All the 184 and 204 trees of the selected eight half-sib genetic families on sites 1 and 2 respectively were tested using TOF acoustic tool, and two 5 mm core samples taken at breast height level (1.3 m) used to for the anatomical and physical properties analysis. The results indicated a significant positive linear relationship between dynamic MOEs (DMOEG and DMOEB) versus tree diameter, slenderness, and fiber length while dynamic MOEs negatively but nonsignificant correlated with MFA. While there was no significant difference in DMOEB between sites; velocity2 for site 1 was significantly higher than site 2 but DMOEG was higher for site 2 than site 1. Again, the mean DMOEG and DMOEB reported in the present study presents a snapshot of the expected static MOE for green and 12% moisture conditions respectively for loblolly pine. Furthermore, there were significant differences between families for most of the traits measured and this suggests that forest managers have the opportunity to select families that exhibit the desired fiber morphology for final product performance. Lastly, since the dynamic MOE based on green density (DMOEG), basic density (DMOEB) and velocity2 present difference conclusions, practitioners of this type of acoustic technique should take care when extrapolating results across the sites."
The Outcome of Bariatric Surgery in Patients Aged 75 years and Older,"Bariatric surgery has been shown to be safe and effective in patients aged 60–75 years; however, outcomes in patients aged 75 or older are undocumented."
Zeaxanthin improved diabetes-induced anxiety and depression through inhibiting inflammation in hippocampus,"It is generally accepted that inflammation plays a key role in anxiety and depression induced by diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism and effective treatment method of these diabetes-associated behavior disorders remain to be determined. In the present study, we attempted to illuminate the implication of zeaxanthin in anxiety, depression and neuroinflammation caused by hyperglycemia, and further elaborate the relevant mechanism under these neuropsychiatric disorders. In the current work, diabetic rats were induced by high glucose and fat diet followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin, and zeaxanthin was orally administration every day (From 6th to 19th week). Diabetes-associated anxiety and depression were assessed using open field test (OFT) and Forced swimming test (FST) respectively. Moreover, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in hippocampus were tested using ELISA and WB. Data showed that long-term zeaxanthin treatment improve diabetic symptoms and alleviate anxiety and depression in diabetic rats. Furthermore, excessive production of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α could be reduced with zeaxanthin treatment. In conclusion, we suggested that zeaxanthin can ameliorate diabetes-associated anxiety and depression, inhibit inflammation in diabetic rats. Our results could provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of abnormal behavior induced by hyperglycemia."
Particle size prediction of magnesium nanoparticle produced by inert gas condensation method,"Properties of nanoparticles are normally depending on particle size; therefore, developing a model to predict particle size is of vital importance. This paper established an energy analysis model to predict average particle size of magnesium nanoparticles fabricated by inert gas condensation method. Predictions of average particle size ranging from 20 to 50 nm by energy analysis model have relative errors of less than 10% compared with experimental research. Further, the model is applied to investigate operation conditions to decrease the average particle size of magnesium nanoparticles. It is found that decreasing the absolute pressure in the condensation room and increasing the temperature rise of the inert gas can both produce nanoparticles with smaller average particle sizes. Temperature rise of the inert gas plays a more important role in effect on average nanoparticle size than the absolute pressure in the condensation room. Energy transformed by collision bonding and dissipated by convection are the dominant processes for particle growth when number of atoms in one particle is greater than 2000 atoms."
"The last terror birds (Aves, Phorusrhacidae): new evidence from the late Pleistocene of Uruguay","We report new fossil evidence of terror bird survival until the end of the Pleistocene in Uruguay. The new specimens comprise the distal portion of right tarsometatarsus and a left humerus; the latter is assigned to the genus Psilopterus. The sedimentary context of the remains yields a characteristic Pleistocene mammalian association along with numerical age dating giving an undoubted late Pleistocene age (OSL 96,040 ± 6300 years). We also revise and discuss the systematic placement of late Pleistocene phorusrhacid material previously published. The trophic role of terror birds and other South American carnivorous birds in late Pleistocene ecosystems should be revised based on the increasing findings of avian 
fossil materials."
A New Perspective on the Risk of Hypercoagulopathy in Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome Using Thromboelastography,"Thromboelastography (TEG) provides real-time assessment of hemostasis by measuring the viscoelastic properties, coagulation factor, and platelet activity in whole blood samples. In this prospective case—control study, we wanted to investigate whether blood clot formation assessment, using TEG, can identify a hypercoagulable state in women with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Thirty-six women who were hospitalized with severe OHSS were allocated to the OHSS group and 32 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation but who did not develop OHSS were allocated to the control group. The TEG indices were compared between women with severe OHSS and controls. All the coagulation indices assessed by TEG were significantly different in the OHSS group compared to the controls, depicting a hypercoagulable state. Median coagulation index was 3.6 (interquartile range: 2.80–4.15) and 1.45 (interquartile range: 0.20–2.30) in study group and controls, respectively (P < .001). Our results show that TEG can be used to depict a hypercoagulable state in women with severe OHSS."
Fibroblast Growth Factor 7 Regulates Proliferation and Decidualization of Human Endometrial Stromal Cells via ERK and JNK Pathway in an Autocrine Manner,"Decidualization is an essential activity of the endometrium in pregnancy, but the molecular mechanisms involving the initiation and maintenance have not yet been clarified. In the present study, we examined the expression of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in endometria, normal decidua, and abortion decidua from miscarriage by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed the expression of FGF7 and FGFR2 and the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), and decidual stromal cells (DSCs) from early pregnancy or miscarriage by In-Cell Western assay. The effect of FGF7 on the proliferation of decidualized ESCs was determined by bromodeoxyuridine proliferation assay. Our results show that the expression of FGF7 protein in the normal decidua is obviously higher than that of the endometrium and the abortion decidua, and the expression of FGF7 in the abortion decidua was still higher than that in the endometrium. The FGF7 expression in ESCs is significantly increased after stimulation with a combination of progesterone and 17β-estradiol or 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate for 12 days. The expression of FGF7 and FGFR2 and the levels of phosphory-lated ERK and JNK in DSCs from normal decidua are markedly higher compared with that in ESCs from the endometrium, and the DSCs from abortion decidua had lower expression than DSCs from normal decidua but still higher than ESCs from the endometrium. Our results suggest that FGF7 may stimulate ESCs proliferation and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and prolactin expressions through ERK and JNK signal pathways in an autocrine manner."
Rosiglitazone Regulates TLR4 and Rescues HO-1 and NRF2 Expression in Myometrial and Decidual Macrophages in Inflammation-Induced Preterm Birth,"Introduction: Elevated inflammation accounts for approximately 30% of preterm birth (PTB) cases. We previously reported that targeting the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway reduced the incidence of PTB in the mouse model of endotoxin-induced PTB. The PPARγ has proven anti-inflammatory functions and its activation via rosiglitazone significantly downregulated the systemic inflammatory response and reduced PTB and stillbirth rate by 30% and 41%, respectively, in our model. Oxidative stress is inseparable from inflammation, and rosiglitazone has a reported antioxidative activity. In the current study, we therefore aimed to evaluate whether rosiglitazone treatment had effects outside of inflammatory pathway, specifically on the antioxidation pathway in our model. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6J mice (E16.5) were treated with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), rosiglitazone (Rosi), lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10μg in 200μL 1XPBS), or LPS + Rosi (6 hours after the LPS injection). The myometrial and decidual tissues were collected and processed for macrophage isolation using magnetic cell sorting and F4/80+ antibody. Expression levels of antioxidative factors—Nrf2 and Ho-1—along with the LPS receptor Tlr4 were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels were assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Results: Both the decidual and myometrial macrophages from the LPS-treated animals showed significantly lowered expression of Ho-1 and Nrf2 and higher expression of Tlr4 when compared to the PBS control group. The macrophages from the animals in the LPS + Rosi group had significantly elevated expression of Ho-1 and Nrf2 and downregulated expression of Tlr4 when compared to the LPS group. Conclusion: Rosiglitazone administration prevents PTB by downregulating inflammation and upregulating antioxidative response."
Quantum corrections to the gravitational backreaction,"Effective field theory techniques are used to study the leading order quantum corrections to the gravitational wave backreaction. The effective stress-energy tensor is calculated and it is shown that it has a non-vanishing trace that contributes to the cosmological constant. By comparing the result obtained with LIGO’s data, the first bound on the amplitude of the massive mode is found: \(\epsilon < 1.4\times 10^{-33}\)."
Functional analysis of Triticum durum type 1 metallothionein gene (dMT) in response to varying levels of cadmium,"The effect of varying levels of cadmium and correlated changes on the expression level of a type 1 metallothionein gene (dMT) were investigated in Triticum durum cv. Balçalı-85. Increasing the cadmium concentration resulted in a decrease in the dry weights of roots and shoots, and the effect was stronger in roots. Roots also showed a higher capacity to accumulate cadmium. Southern blot analyses revealed that the dMT gene, delineated by two exons and a non-coding intron region, exists at a single locus in the T. durum genome. Changes in dMT gene expression during cadmium exposure were monitored by two approaches. Northern blot analyses showed that the transcript level in roots increased upon treatment with increasing cadmium, which was quantified by qRT-PCR as 4.5 fold of the base level at 10 μM Cd. These results show a positive correlation between cadmium exposure and expression of dMT gene in durum wheat, and will provide a basis for studies on the role of type 1 metallothioneins in cadmium response."
Sizing optimization for island microgrid with pumped storage system considering demand response,"Currently, small islands are facing an energy supply shortage, which has led to considerable concern. Establishing an island microgrid is a relatively good solution to the problem. However, high investment costs restrict its application. In this paper, micro pumped storage (MPS) is used as an energy storage system (ESS) for islands with good geographical conditions, and deferrable appliance is treated as the virtual power source which can be used in the planning and operational processes. Household acceptance of demand response (DR) is indicated by the demand response participation degree (DRPD), and a sizing optimization model for considering the demand response of household appliances in an island microgrid is proposed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to obtain the optimal sizing of all major devices. In addition, the battery storage (BS) scheme is used as the control group. The results of case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, and the DR of deferrable appliances and the application of MPS can significantly reduce island microgrid investment. Sensitivity analysis on the total load of the island and the water head of the MPS are conducted."
Modeling and analysis of mixed convection stagnation point flow of nanofluid towards a stretching surface: OHAM and FEM approach,"A theoretical study of mixed convection stagnation point flow towards a stretching surface is presented. The governing boundary layer equations are transformed into a set of highly nonlinear ordinary differential equations using suitable similarity transforms. The semi-analytical solution is obtained using optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) and the numerical solution is obtained via finite element method (FEM). Solutions obtained via two different approaches are in excellent agreement, which validates the accuracy of present analysis. In a special case, the present OHAM solution is also validated with the earlier available results. Effect of pertinent flow parameters on the skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number is presented in tabular form, whereas the velocity, temperature and nanoparticle distribution are presented in graphical forms. Further, a quadratic multiple regression analysis on numeric data of skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number is performed. The findings suggest that velocity slip assists the fluid motion in presence of buoyancy forces, whereas it exhibits a retarding nature on fluid motion when no buoyancy forces exist."
"Inhibition of VEGF Signaling Reduces Diabetes-Exacerbated Brain Swelling, but Not Infarct Size, in Large Cerebral Infarction in Mice","In light of repeated translational failures with preclinical neuroprotection-based strategies, this preclinical study reevaluates brain swelling as an important pathological event in diabetic stroke and investigates underlying mechanism of the comorbidity-enhanced brain edema formation. Type 2 (mild), type 1 (moderate), and mixed type 1/2 (severe) diabetic mice were subjected to transient focal ischemia. Infarct volume, brain swelling, and IgG extravasation were assessed at 3 days post-stroke. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, endothelial-specific molecule-1 (Esm1), and the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was determined in the ischemic brain. Additionally, SU5416, a VEGFR2 inhibitor, was treated in the type 1/2 diabetic mice, and stroke outcomes were determined. All diabetic groups displayed bigger infarct volume and brain swelling compared to nondiabetic mice, and the increased swelling was disproportionately larger relative to infarct enlargement. Diabetic conditions significantly increased VEGF-A, Esm1, and VEGFR2 expressions in the ischemic brain compared to nondiabetic mice. Notably, in diabetic mice, VEGFR2 mRNA levels were positively correlated with brain swelling, but not with infarct volume. Treatment with SU5416 in diabetic mice significantly reduced brain swelling. The study shows that brain swelling is a predominant pathological event in diabetic stroke and that an underlying event for diabetes-enhanced brain swelling includes the activation of VEGF signaling. This study suggests consideration of stroke therapies aiming at primarily reducing brain swelling for subjects with diabetes."
Efficient and secure auditing scheme for privacy preserving data storage in cloud,"An on-demand computing in which data is stored in a remote manner and provision of services is from a pool of resources of computing that is shared is known as Cloud computing. The cloud computing fulfills the need of store and oversee show. Though to get to and secure information, numerous exceptional advancements like parallel and guide diminish strategies are accessible. The burden of usage from maintenance and storage of native data is eliminated and the owner additionally benefits from elimination of the responsibility of security and storage (Gourkhede and Theng, 2014 fourth international conference on communication systems and network technologies (CSNT), pp 677–680, 2014; Modi, J Supercomput 63(2):561–592, 2013; Smys and Bala, Clust Comput 15(3):211–222, 2012). In order to ensure modification of the accuracy of the on-demand data and its due verification on the cloud owners’ behalf, a methodology that is innovative is needed. The encryption and file split up is done using a novel secure cryptography hashing algorithm. Once the data is uploaded the user is provided with a private and public key for trustworthy retrieval of the data file. Those keys are generated using a proposed modified RSA cryptosystem algorithm. A multilevel hash tree algorithm is used to efficiently audit the data file occasionally. The implementation and therefore the results show the potency and efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to the existing algorithm."
Visual and textual features based email spam classification using S-Cuckoo search and hybrid kernel support vector machine,"Spam mail classification has been playing a vital role in recent days due to the uncontrollable growth happening in the electronic media. Literature presents several algorithms for email spam classification based on classification methods. In this paper, we propose a spam classification framework using S-Cuckoo and hybrid kernel based support vector machine (HKSVM). At first, the features are extracted from the e-mails based on the text as well as the image. For the textual features, TF-term frequency is used. For the image dependent features, correrlogram and wavelet moment are taken. The hybrid features have then high dimension so the optimum features are identified with the help of hybrid algorithm, called S-Cuckoo search. Then, the classification is done using proposed classifier HKSVM model which is designed based on the hybrid kernel by blending three different kernel functions and then it is used in the SVM classifier. The additional features provided based on image and the modification of SVM classifier provides significant improvement as compared with existing algorithms. The spam classification performance is measured by db1 (combining bare-ling spam and Spam Archive corpus) and db2 (combining lemm-ling spam and Spam Archive corpus). Experimental results show that the proposed spam classification framework has outperformed by having better accuracy of 97.235% when compared with existing approach which is able to achieve only 94.117%."
Proposing a delay in payment contract for coordinating a two-echelon periodic review supply chain with stochastic promotional effort dependent demand,"In a decentralized supply chain (SC), each member individually makes decisions according to its personal objectives while these decisions impact on the other SC actors. The promotional effort made by retailers is one of the main factors that largely impacts on the market demand of a commodity, which in turn boosts the profitability of the whole SC members. In this paper, we investigate coordination of promotional effort and replenishment decisions in a two-echelon SC including single supplier and single retailer. The investigated SC faces a stochastic demand influenced by the retailer’s promotional effort. To replenish items, the retailer uses a periodic review inventory system and decides on the review period, order-up-to-level and promotional effort. On the other side, the supplier employs a periodic review lot-for-lot strategy and determines its replenishment cycle multiplier. Firstly, we model the SC under the decentralized and centralized decision-making models. Exact solution procedures are presented using mathematical and concavity analysis to obtain the decentralized and centralized optimal solutions. Afterwards, a coordination model based on delay in payment contract is proposed to motivate the retailer to participate in the joint decision-making model. To create a more realistic model, in the proposed models we assume that the SC members’ rates of return on investment are different. The minimum and maximum length of credit period which are acceptable to both members are determined. Finally, numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are conducted to investigate the performance and applicability of the developed models. The results show that the proposed coordination scheme considerably improves the profitability of both SC members and the whole SC in comparison with the decentralized setting."
Physicochemical characterization of sterilized muds for pharmaceutics/cosmetics applications,"Clays and muds have been used for centuries as cosmetics or pharmaceutical products for various therapies. The suitability of muds and clays for health- and beauty-related applications depends on their physicochemical properties, mineralogical composition, particle characteristics and toxicity. In this work, the physicochemical characterization of 12 mud specimens from different natural spa resorts in Greece and one from Israel (Dead Sea) is presented. All specimens were sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min, because of their intended use. The Greek mud specimens were collected from various locations in Macedonia, Western Greece and Northeast Aegean. All muds were characterized concerning their mineralogical, chemical components as well as their morphological characteristics using appropriate methods [powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nitrogen absorption specific surface area measurements (BET), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]. The concentrations of F−, Cl−, NO3− and SO42− anions at equilibrium with the mud specimens were measured by ion chromatography. Total calcium concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and the concentration of total N, C, H and S in the solids was measured using elemental analysis. Moreover, total phenolic concentration (TPC) in distilled water equilibrated with the mud specimens was measured as an index for their antioxidant properties. Several muds were found to present high TPC. Several of the examined mud specimens were found to have the potential use as pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. Based on the physicochemical characteristics of the mud specimens examined, possible improvement in their use and applicability has been suggested."

Anti-PD-1-induced high-grade hepatitis associated with corticosteroid-resistant T cells: a case report,"Effective treatment or prevention of immune side effects associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy of cancer is an important goal in this new era of immunotherapy. Hepatitis due to immunotherapy with antibodies against PD-1 is uncommon and generally of low severity. We present an unusually severe case arising in a melanoma patient after more than 6 months uncomplicated treatment with anti-PD-1 in an adjuvant setting. The hepatitis rapidly developed resistance to high-dose steroids, requiring anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) to achieve control. Mass cytometry allowed comprehensive phenotyping of circulating lymphocytes and revealed that CD4+ T cells were profoundly depleted by ATG, while CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes were relatively spared. Multiple abnormalities in CD4+ T cell phenotype were stably present in the patient before disease onset. These included a population of CCR4−CCR6− effector/memory CD4+ T cells expressing intermediate levels of the Th1-related chemokine receptor CXCR3 and abnormally high multi-drug resistance type 1 transporter (MDR1) activity as assessed by a rhodamine 123 excretion assay. Expression of MDR1 has been implicated in steroid resistance and may have contributed to the severity and lack of a sustained steroid response in this patient. The number of CD4+ rhodamine 123-excreting cells was reduced > 3.5-fold after steroid and ATG treatment. This case illustrates the need to consider this form of steroid resistance in patients failing treatment with corticosteroids. It also highlights the need for both better identification of patients at risk and the development of treatments that involve more specific immune suppression."
Systematic investigation of mechanically alloyed Ti-Mg-Ni used as negative electrode in Ni-MH battery,"In this study, a series of Ti-Mg-Ni alloys have been synthesized by mechanical alloying using a planetary high-energy ball mill. The effect of varied composition on the microstructure and electrochemical hydrogenation properties of Ti-Mg-Ni system have been investigated through the compared analysis of Ti1-xMgNix and TiMg1-xNix alloys. The structural transformation and discharge capacities were characterized by XRD and electrochemical measurements at galvanostatic conditions, respectively. Additionally, a separate milling process has been employed for improving the electrochemical properties of Ti-Mg-Ni alloys. It is shown that the separated milling process can extremely enhance the discharge capacities of Ti-Mg-Ni composite materials."
Risk of serious infections in biological treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis: a meta-analysis,"The objective of the study is to quantitatively assess the risk of serious infections in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) treated by biologics enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic literature searches of MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and abstracts archives of the annual scientific meetings of both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) was conducted through October 2015. The RCTs that compared the safety of any biologics treatment for AS or nr-axSpA with placebo and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with a minimum of 12 weeks of follow-up were selected independently by 2 reviewers. Twenty-five RCTs with data from 2403 patients were analyzed in the analysis. Patients included active AS in 21 studies and nr-axSpA in 4 studies were treated by 5 TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab) and 3 non-TNF inhibitors (sarilumab, tocilizumab, secukinumab). The risk of serious infections has no difference and numerically was only slightly increased in patients with AS and nr-axSpA treated by biologics compared with controls (OR = 1.42; 95%CI 0.58–3.47). Stratified analysis yielded the pooled risk differences (RDs) of 0.00 (95%CI, − 0.01 to 0.01), 0.01 (95%CI − 0.01 to 0.03), − 0.00 (95%CI −0.01 to 0.01), 0.00 (95%CI − 0.02 to 0.02), 0.01 (95%CI −0.01 to 0.03) and 0.01 (95%CI −0.02 to 0.04) for adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab and non-TNF inhibitors respectively. There are also no significant effect of biologics on serious infections was observed compared with controls in patients with AS (p = 0.29) and nr-axSpA (p = 0.89). The use of biologics among patients with AS and nr-axSpA included in RCTs was not significantly associated with an increased risk of serious infections compared with placebo or NSAIDs or DMARDs."
An adaption scheduling based on dynamic weighted random forests for load demand forecasting,"With the development of cloud computing, energy consumption has become a major and costly problem in data centers. To improve the energy efficiency of data centers, we analyze the influence factors of energy consumption and discover that reducing the idle servers can effectively cut down the energy consumption of data centers. Then the load demand forecasting algorithm using weighted random forests is proposed. And time factor matching coefficient obtained by considering the day type and the time span is employed to calculate the weights. To enhance the forecasting performance, an error correction strategy is also introduced into the forecasting model. The experimental results show that these strategies further improve the prediction accuracy, and the root-mean-square error is 2.6–4.1% lower than other forecasting algorithms. We finally design an adaptive scheduling technology that utilizes short-term prediction of load demand. This technology adaptively adjusts the scale of the data center cluster based on the forecast results. The simulation results indicate that the technology can reduce 12.5% energy consumption while ensuring the service quality."
Discussions on the correspondence of dissipative particle dynamics and Langevin dynamics at small scales,"We investigate the behavior of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) within different scaling regimes by numerical simulations. The paper extends earlier analytical findings of Ripoll, M., Ernst, M. H., and Espa˜nol, P. (Large scale and mesoscopic hydrodynamics for dissipative particle dynamics. Journal of Chemical Physics, 115(15), 7271–7281 (2001)) by evaluation of numerical data for the particle and collective scaling regimes and the four different subregimes. DPD simulations are performed for a range of dynamic overlapping parameters. Based on analyses of the current auto-correlation functions (CACFs), we demonstrate that within the particle regime at scales smaller than its force cut-off radius, DPD follows Langevin dynamics. For the collective regime, we show that the small-scale behavior of DPD differs from Langevin dynamics. For the wavenumber-dependent effective shear viscosity, universal scaling regimes are observed in the microscopic and mesoscopic wavenumber ranges over the considered range of dynamic overlapping parameters."
Structure of a gadolinium coordination compound with acyldihydrazone of adipic acid and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one,The structure of a gadolinium coordination compound with acyldihydrazone of adipic acid and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one is studied by the XRD. It is determined that the compound is built as a spacer-armed dinuclear complex in which coordination polyhedra are linked by three aliphatic bridges packed in the asymmetric triple helix. The coordination polyhedron of the gadolinium cation has a slightly distorted three-capped trigonal prism geometry.
Study of a supramolecular structure of continental type petroleum asphaltenes,"Supramolecular, electronic, and chemical structures of petroleum asphaltene molecules are studied. The investigations are carried out by quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics methods. The quantum chemical calculation of the structure-chemical parameters of dimers and trimers of petroleum asphaltenes is made using DFT/B3LYP. The refined values of the ionization potential and electron affinity of petroleum asphaltene molecules, their dimers and trimers agree well with the electron spectroscopy data. The results of the study of geometric structures of petroleum asphaltene dimers and trimers confirm the non-planar structure of asphaltenes."

"Nano-formulation for topical treatment of precancerous lesions: skin penetration, in vitro, and in vivo toxicological evaluation","With the aim of improving the topical delivery of the antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU), it was loaded into ultradeformable liposomes composed of soy phosphatidylcholine and sodium cholate (UDL-5FU). The liposome populations had a mean size of 70 nm without significant changes in 56 days, and the ultradeformable formulations were up to 324-fold more elastic than conventional liposomes. The interaction between 5FU and the liposomal membrane was studied by three methods, and also release profile was obtained. UDL-5FU did penetrate the stratum corneum of human skin. At in vitro experiments, the formulation was more toxic on a human melanoma-derived than on a human keratinocyte-derived cell line. Cells captured liposomes by metabolically active processes. In vivo toxicity experiments were carried out in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae by studying the swimming activity, morphological changes, and alterations in the heart rate after incubation. UDL-5FU was more toxic than free 5FU. Therefore, this nano-formulation could be useful for topical application in deep skin precancerous lesions with advantages over current treatments. This is the first work that assessed the induction of apoptosis, skin penetration in a Saarbrücken penetration model, and the toxicological effects in vivo of an ultradeformable 5FU-loaded formulation."
"Effect of genetic sources on anatomical, morphological, and mechanical properties of 14-year-old genetically improved loblolly pine families from two sites in the southern United States","Tree improvement programs on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) in the southeastern USA has focused primarily on improving growth, form, and disease tolerance. However, due to the recent reduction of design values for visually graded southern yellow pine lumber (including loblolly pine), attention has been drawn to the material quality of genetically improved loblolly pine. In this study, we used the time-of-flight (TOF) acoustic tool to assess the effect of genetic families on diameter, slenderness, fiber length, microfibril angle (MFA), velocity and dynamic stiffness estimated using green density (DMOEG) and basic density (DMOEB) of 14-year-old loblolly pine stands selected from two sites. All the 184 and 204 trees of the selected eight half-sib genetic families on sites 1 and 2 respectively were tested using TOF acoustic tool, and two 5 mm core samples taken at breast height level (1.3 m) used to for the anatomical and physical properties analysis. The results indicated a significant positive linear relationship between dynamic MOEs (DMOEG and DMOEB) versus tree diameter, slenderness, and fiber length while dynamic MOEs negatively but nonsignificant correlated with MFA. While there was no significant difference in DMOEB between sites; velocity2 for site 1 was significantly higher than site 2 but DMOEG was higher for site 2 than site 1. Again, the mean DMOEG and DMOEB reported in the present study presents a snapshot of the expected static MOE for green and 12% moisture conditions respectively for loblolly pine. Furthermore, there were significant differences between families for most of the traits measured and this suggests that forest managers have the opportunity to select families that exhibit the desired fiber morphology for final product performance. Lastly, since the dynamic MOE based on green density (DMOEG), basic density (DMOEB) and velocity2 present difference conclusions, practitioners of this type of acoustic technique should take care when extrapolating results across the sites."
Zeaxanthin improved diabetes-induced anxiety and depression through inhibiting inflammation in hippocampus,"It is generally accepted that inflammation plays a key role in anxiety and depression induced by diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism and effective treatment method of these diabetes-associated behavior disorders remain to be determined. In the present study, we attempted to illuminate the implication of zeaxanthin in anxiety, depression and neuroinflammation caused by hyperglycemia, and further elaborate the relevant mechanism under these neuropsychiatric disorders. In the current work, diabetic rats were induced by high glucose and fat diet followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin, and zeaxanthin was orally administration every day (From 6th to 19th week). Diabetes-associated anxiety and depression were assessed using open field test (OFT) and Forced swimming test (FST) respectively. Moreover, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in hippocampus were tested using ELISA and WB. Data showed that long-term zeaxanthin treatment improve diabetic symptoms and alleviate anxiety and depression in diabetic rats. Furthermore, excessive production of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α could be reduced with zeaxanthin treatment. In conclusion, we suggested that zeaxanthin can ameliorate diabetes-associated anxiety and depression, inhibit inflammation in diabetic rats. Our results could provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of abnormal behavior induced by hyperglycemia."
Multi-classifier ensemble based on dynamic weights,"In this study, a novel multi-classifier ensemble method based on dynamic weights is proposed to reduce the interference of unreliable decision information and improve the accuracy of fusion decision. The algorithm defines decision credibility to describe the real-time importance of the classifier to the current target, combines this credibility with the reliability calculated by the classifier on the training data set and dynamically assigns the fusion weight to the classifier. Compared with other methods, the contribution of different classifiers to fusion decision in acquiring weights is fully evaluated in consideration of the capability of the classifier to not only identify different sample regions but also output decision information when identifying specific targets. Experimental results on public face databases show that the proposed method can obtain higher classification accuracy than that of single classifier and some popular fusion algorithms. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified."
Is the Problem of Population Aging Real? An Answer Obtained from the Labor Force Participation of the G7 Countries,"Old-age dependency ratio (OADR) is commonly used to indicate the financial burden of population aging; increases in OADR have caused widespread concerns. To better measure the financial burden, this paper proposes a dependency ratio of non-labor-force population to labor-force population (NLDR). This ratio includes OADR as a special case. This paper finds that, when measured by NLDR, financial burden actually declined in five of the G7 countries during the years 2000–2014. To project future trends, labor force participation rates by age f(x) can be forecasted using the coherent Lee-Carter method. This paper combines the forecasted f(x) and the population projections of the United Nations, to forecast increases of NLDR for the G7 countries between 2014 and 2050. These increases are on average less than one-fifth of the increases projected for OADR. Because OADR ignores the increase of labor force participation, its description of the problem of population aging for the G7 countries in the past is unrealistic and inaccurate, and forecasts of the future based on OADR are likely to be just as unrealistic. Understanding the conditions and reasons for increases in labor force participation can provide valuable insights into the issues of population aging in China, where the remarkable increase of OADR may result in real financial burdens. One condition for labor force participation to increase could be that people remain in good health, which makes continuing to work more feasible. Other reasons for labor force participation to increase are likely to be found in government policies that encourage people to continue working longer. For China, collecting reliable data on labor force participation is also crucial. Without these data, the effects of the policies that encourage people to continue working longer cannot be detected; and therefore the policies cannot be properly developed."
Hukou-Restricted Migration and Migrants’ Health: Evidence and Policy Implication,"Since the 1980s, rapid economic development in China has continued to attract great numbers of migrants from rural to urban labor markets. As a result, the constraints of the hukou registration system on migration flows have gradually declined. Nevertheless, institutional barriers associated with the hukou remain for migrants in their social integration in destination. And these have led to substantial negative impacts on migrants’ physical, social and psychological wellbeing."
Increased precipitation modulates the influence of nitrogen and litter inputs on the nutrient resorption proficiency rather than efficiency of Leymus chinensis,"Resorption of nutrients from senescing organs is an important conservation mechanism that is usually influenced by the supply of soil nutrients and plant growth requirements. Therefore, it is likely that increases in nitrogen (N), precipitation, and litter could lead to changes in nutrient resorption because of changes in nutrients in the soil and accelerated plant growth in response to the alleviation of water limitations in arid and semiarid environments. In the current study, we investigated the effects of water, N, and litter addition on the nutrient resorption efficiency and proficiency of N and phosphorus (P) in leaves and stems of Leymus chinensis in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results showed that N addition significantly decreased the N resorption efficiency in leaves under water addition, and increased P resorption efficiency under ambient precipitation conditions. There was no apparent influence of either litter or water addition on N and P resorption efficiencies. However, N and litter addition significantly altered N and P resorption proficiencies, and these effects were modulated by water availability. Furthermore, changes in resorption proficiencies were mainly associated with alterations in the nutritional status of green organs in response to water, N and litter addition, except for leaf P. Our findings highlight the importance of increased precipitation in modulating the nutrient resorption proficiency of plants under potentially increased nutrient availability in semiarid grasslands. Therefore, global changes in precipitation and N, and corresponding litter changes could result in complex effects on plant nutrient economies and, in turn, could influence the return of nutrients to the soil."
Synergistic Effects of Carbon Nanotube/Nano-MoS2 Hybrid on Tribological Performance of Polyimide Nanocomposite Films,"Modified carbon nanotube/nano-MoS2 (CMS) hybrid as a self-lubricating and anti-wear nanofiller was prepared through chemical compounding and then incorporated into polyimide (PI) matrix to yield CMS/PI composite by in situ polymerization. For comparison, carbon nanotube (CNT), nano-MoS2 as well as the mixture of them (CNT-MoS2) were also incorporated into PI matrix separately to evaluate the superior performance of CMS hybrid. Morphology, mechanical capacity and tribological behavior of the as-prepared nanocomposites were investigated, and the discrepancies on the above-mentioned properties caused by the different structures between CMS hybrid and CNT-MoS2 mixture were discussed in detail. With only 0.5 wt% addition of CMS, the friction coefficient and wear rate of CMS/PI composite decreased by 31 and 84%, respectively, compared to virgin PI. The results showed that the combinational structure of CMS hybrid, as CNT-coated few-layer MoS2 nanosheet, which took the advantage of both CNT and nano-MoS2, contributed to the synergistic effect on the tribological properties."
Brewing beer in wine country? First archaeobotanical indications for beer making in Early and Middle Bronze Age Greece,"This paper revisits and old question “Beer or wine?” as regards the potential alcoholic drinks consumed by prehistoric societies in southeastern Europe. Archaeobotanical remains of sprouted cereal grains as well as cereal fragments from the Bronze Age sites of Archondiko and Argissa on mainland Greece, presented here for the first time, provide strong indications for the making of something similar to beer in late 3rd millennium bc Greece, opening up a series of new questions about the recipes followed in this process and their origins. Beyond the recipes themselves, the paper highlights a range of available options as regards alcoholic drinks in Bronze Age Greece, beer and wine, offering thus a more detailed approach to preferences and possible identities reflected in the choice of alcoholic drink among prehistoric societies inhabiting the southernmost tip of the Balkan Peninsula, the Aegean and mainland Greece."
The Younger Dryas and Preboreal landscape in the Moervaart area (northwestern Belgium) and the apparent decrease in human occupation,"This paper presents the results of multi-disciplinary research carried out on the deposits of a residual channel (“Peerdemeers”) of the Kale/Durme River in the Moervaart depression, NW Belgium. The combination of physical, botanical, zoological and chemical analyses allowed a detailed reconstruction of the channel ecosystem and the vegetation in the surrounding landscape during the Younger Dryas and Early Holocene. A chronology for the record was provided by radiocarbon dating. Vegetation patterns were influenced by major climate changes that occurred during this period. During the early Younger Dryas, the river channel was active and vegetation was open with scattered birch copses, shrubs, grasses and herbs. The channel was cut-off in the late Younger Dryas, while some heath developed in the area. The Friesland Phase is characterised by a lithological change and increase in water level in the residual channel. Dwarf birch disappeared and boreal forests developed. The area however, remained relatively open compared to other coversand areas in NW Europe. The Rammelbeek Phase is considered as a drier, more continental climate phase in which forest expansion was temporarily interrupted and grasslands became more abundant. Also at the “Peerdemeers” site an increase in grasses is recorded. During the entire period (ca. 1,000 years) there is no hard evidence for human activity. The absence of archaeological evidence is in sharp contrast with the preceding (Allerød) and succeeding periods (Boreal). This suggests that environmental conditions during the YD and PB were probably too unfavourable for hunter-gatherers to remain in the Moervaart area."
Cereal cultivation as a correlate of high social status in medieval Iceland,"Utilising a multi-profile palynological approach and a rapid scanning technique, this paper examines whether or not cereal cultivation is representative of a medieval Icelandic farmstead’s social status; first as a correlate by confirming that cereals were grown in association with the archaeological features characteristic of high status and second, as an indicator in its own right through comparison with other datasets from inferred lower status farms in the same valley. The results suggest that medieval cereal cultivation in Mosfellsdalur was confined to the landholding of the Mosfell Estate. This is probably a direct consequence of the locale being settled early during Iceland’s colonisation and thereby allowing settlers there to secure the prime location in the valley for agriculture. The later abandonment of cereal cultivation on the Estate also appears to be linked to social circumstances in Mosfellsdalur c. ad 1200. An evaluation of other pollen studies and historical sources intimates a transition in cereal cultivation from inland toward coastal (and perhaps geothermal) sites in the mid-13th century, probably as a consequence of the onset of the Little Ice Age. These sites may also be linked with high status institutions. Despite this effort to adapt to altered climate conditions, cereal cultivation in Iceland is believed to have been completely abandoned by ad 1500. Overall, the temporal and spatial dynamics of cereal cultivation are shown to be complex, subject to both societal and environmental changes."
The clinical value of assessing right ventricular diastolic function after balloon pulmonary angioplasty in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has a poor prognosis because of the associated progressive right heart failure. Accurate evaluation of right ventricular (RV) function would thus be useful to predict prognosis. However, the significance of RV diastolic function remains unclear. We aimed to identify which echocardiographic measures are most accurate, and potentially useful, in assessing RV diastolic function in patients with CTEPH, and to study the effects of balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) on them. We enrolled 53 CTEPH patients who underwent BPA. Echocardiographic parameters, including two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography, were compared to the hemodynamic parameters measured by right heart catheterization before and after BPA. RV strain rate during early diastole (SR_E), tricuspid e′ and right atrial area (RAA) were ameliorated after BPA, concomitant with a decrease in the time constant of the RV pressure curve during diastole (tau), indicating the improvement of RV diastolic function. Among them, SR_E had the strongest correlation with tau (r = − 0.39, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that E/SR_E (AUC 0.704) and inferior vena cava diameter (AUC 0.726) had a stronger association with higher mean right atrial pressure than RAA (AUC 0.632). In contrast, RAA had a stronger correlation with 6 min-walk distances than SR_E (r = − 0.39, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.30, p = 0.005). Taken together, echocardiographic assessment of RV diastolic function might be associated with hemodynamics as well as exercise tolerance in patients with CTEPH, indicating its benefits in evaluating the therapeutic effects of BPA."
Environmental factors on virulence of Aeromonas hydrophila,"Aeromonas hydrophila are known for being opportunistic pathogens, harboring various virulence factors and triggering lesions and death in fish. The disease caused by bacteria can make fish inappropriate for human consumption, besides representing a risk to public health. The pathogenesis can be influenced by environmental variables, affecting fish productivity and mortality. The present study aimed to determine whether A. hydrophila harbor the virulence genes aerolysin, hydrolipase, elastase, lipase, cytotonic enterotoxin (ast), lateral flagellum (laf), and polar flagellum (fla) and to evaluate the influence of environmental variables on in vitro growth, in vivo virulence and expression of some of these genes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening for the presence of these virulence genes was performed on 35 isolates. Six isolates containing different profiles of virulence genes were tested for in vitro growth under different conditions of pH, temperature, and ammonia and for in vivo virulence under these same environmental conditions. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the expression of aerolysin, lipase, and fla genes. All the tested environmental factors influenced the growth of A. hydrophila, while pH and ammonia concentrations influenced the bacterial virulence. The expression of the fla gene increased when bacteria were grown in higher ammonia concentration. The mortality established by Aeromonas is influenced by several environmental factors pinpointing the importance of its control in fish farming to avoid higher economic loses associated to bacterial disease outbreaks."
Difference in causes and prognostic factors of early death between cohorts with de novo and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia,"Early death (ED) remains the most critical issue in the current care of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Very limited data are available regarding ED in patients with relapsed APL. In this retrospective study, 285 de novo and 79 relapsed patients were included. All patients received single-agent arsenic trioxide as induction therapy. The differences in baseline clinical features, incidence, causes, and prognostic factors of ED were compared between the two patient cohorts. The relapse cohort exhibited a better overall condition than the de novo cohort upon hospital admission. The ED rate in the relapsed patients (24.1%) was somewhat higher than that in the de novo patients (17.9%), although the difference was not significant (P = 0.219). For both cohorts, hemorrhage was the main cause of ED, followed by differentiation syndrome, infection, and other causes. Increased serum creatinine level, older age, male sex, white blood cell (WBC) count > 10 × 109/L, and fibrinogen < 1 g/L were independently risk factors for ED in the de novo patients, whereas WBC count > 10 × 109/L, elevated serum uric acid level, and D-dimer > 4 mg/L were independent risk factors for ED in the relapsed patients. These data furnish clinically relevant information that might be useful for designing more appropriate risk-adapted treatment protocols aimed at reducing ED rate in patients with relapsed APL."
"Glycomyces tritici sp. nov., isolated from rhizosphere soil of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and emended description of the genus Glycomyces","A novel actinomycete strain, designated NEAU-C2T, was isolated from rhizosphere soil of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of this strain were consistent with the description of the genus Glycomyces. Growth was found to occur at a temperature range of 15–40 °C, pH 6–10 and NaCl concentrations of 0–4%. The cell wall was found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and the whole cell sugars were identified as galactose, xylose and ribose. The predominant menaquinones were identified as MK-10(H6) and MK-10(H2). The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphoglycolipids and an unidentified glycolipid. The major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, anteiso-C17:0 and iso-C15:0. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain NEAU-C2T belongs to the genus Glycomyces with high sequence similarity to Glycomyces algeriensis NRRL B-16327T (99.0% sequence similarity). Some physiological and biochemical properties and low DNA–DNA relatedness values enabled the strain to be differentiated from closely related species of the genus Glycomyces. It is concluded that the isolate can be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Glycomyces, for which the name Glycomyces tritici is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-C2T (= DSM 104644T = CGMCC 4.7410T)."
Comparison of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in three different C57BL/6N mouse substrains,"Adaptive immunity is a type of immune response mediated by T and B cells, and is important response for immune response amplification and memory. In this study, the adaptive immunologic properties of C57BL/6NKorl substrain were compared with those of two other C57BL/6N substrains. There were no significant differences between the C57BL/6NKorl and the two other C57BL/6N substrains in the histological structures of the thymus and spleen, which are immunologic organs containing T cell and B cells. In addition, flow cytometric analysis did not reveal any significant differences in the distribution of T and B cell populations of the three substrains. To evaluate cell-mediated immunity of T cells in the three different substrains, we treated isolated T cells from spleen with Con A. The T cells of C57BL/ 6NKorl showed Con A-dependent proliferation of T cells at lower cell number than those in T cells from the other two C57BL/6N substrains. B cell-mediated humoral immune responses were not significant different among the three substrains. Thus, the results of this study provide evidence that C57BL/6NKorl mice are similar to those two other C57BL/6N substrains in humoral immunity, but C57BL/6NKorl has stronger response in cell mediated immunity."
Comparative study of fertilization rates of C57BL/6NKorl and C57BL/6N mice obtained from two other sources,"C57BL/6N is the most widely used inbred mouse strain applied in a wide variety of research areas including cancer, cardiovascular biology, developmental biology, diabetes and obesity, genetics, immunology, neurobiology, and sensorineural research. To compare the fertilization rates of C57BL/6NKorl mice with two commercial C57BL/6N stocks, differences in reproductive organ structures, sperm and egg numbers, fertilization rates, and embryo development rates among C57BL/6NKorl (Korea FDA source), C57BL/6NA (USA source), and C57BL/6NB (Japan source) mice were determined. Among the stocks, no significant differences were detected in organ weight and histological structure of male and female reproductive organs, although body weight was higher in C57BL/6NKorl mice than that in the other groups. The concentration and morphology of sperm and eggs in C57BL/6NKorl mice were similar to those of C57BL/6NA and C57BL/6NB mice. Furthermore, the three stocks had similar in vitro fertilization and embryo development rates, although these rates tended to be higher in C57BL/6NB mice. Pup body weight was higher in C57BL/6NKorl and C57BL/6NB mice than that in C57BL/6NA mice. The results of the present study suggest that C57BL/6NKorl, C57BL/6NA, and C57BL/6NB mice obtained from three different sources have similar fertilization and embryo development rates, although there were slight differences in the magnitude of their responses rates."
Over-expression of myosin7A in cochlear hair cells of circling mice,"Circling mouse (C57BL/6J-cir/cir) deleted the transmembrane inner ear (Tmie) gene is an animal model for human non-syndromic recessive deafness, DFNB6. In circling mouse, hair cells in the cochlea have degenerated and hair bundles have become irregularity as time goes on. Tmie protein carries out a function of the mechanoelectrical transduction channel in cochlear hair cells. Myosin7a (MYO7A) protein has key roles in development of the cochlear hair bundles as well as in the function of cochlear hair cells. To find whether Tmie protein interacts with MYO7A proteins in the cochlea postnatal developmental stage, we investigated expression of the MYO7A proteins in the cochlear hair cells of circling mice by western blot analysis and whole mount immunofluorescence at postnatal day 5 (P5). The expression of MYO7A showed statistically significant increase in the cochlea of C57BL/6J-+/cir and C57BL/6J-cir/cir mice than that of C57BL/6J-+/+ mice. The MYO7A intensity of the cochlear hair cells also increased in C57BL/6J-+/cir and C57BL/6J-cir/cir mice compared with those of C57BL/6J-+/+ mice. Taken together, the results indicate that Tmie protein may have an important role with MYO7A protein in the development and maintenance of the stereociliary bundles during postnatal developmental stage of the cochlea."
Immunomodulatory effects of ethanol extract of germinated ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum),"The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory activity of ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) extract (IPE) in vitro and in vivo. Raji (a human B cell line) and Jurkat (a human T cell line) cells were treated with various doses of IPE and cell proliferation was measured by WST assay. Results showed that IPE promoted the proliferation of both Raji and Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. IPE also enhanced IL-6 and TNF-α production in macrophages in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), although IPE alone did not induce cytokine production. Moreover, IPE treatment upregulated iNOS gene expression in macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner and led to the production of nitric oxide in macrophages in the presence of IFNγ. In vivo studies revealed that oral administration of IPE for 2 weeks increased the differentiation of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells in splenocytes. These findings suggested that IPE has immunomodulatory effects and could be developed as an immunomodulatory supplement."
Annual tendency of research papers used ICR mice as experimental animals in biomedical research fields,"Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice have been widely used in various research fields including toxicology, oncology, pharmacology, and pharmaceutical product safety testing for decades. However, annual tendency of research papers involving ICR mice in various biomedical fields has not been previously analyzed. In this study, we examined the numbers of papers that used ICR mice as experimental animals in the social science, natural science, engineering, medicine-pharmacy, marine agriculture-fishery, and art-kinesiology fields by analyzing big data. Numbers of ICR mouse-used papers gradually increased from 1961 to 2014, but small decreases were observed in 2015 and 2016. The largest number of ICR-used papers were published in the medicine-pharmacy field, followed by natural science and art-kinesiology fields. There were no ICR mouse-used papers in other fields. Furthermore, ICR mice have been widely employed in cell biology studies within the natural science field as well as in biochemistry and pathology in the medicine-pharmacy field. Few ICR mouse-used papers were published in exercise biochemistry and exercise nutrition in the art-kinesiology field. Regardless in most fields, the total numbers of published papers involving ICR mice were higher in 2014 than in other years, although the numbers in some fields including dentistry, veterinary science, and dermatology were high in 2016. Taken together, the present study shows that various ICR stocks, including Korl:ICR mice, are widely employed as experimental animals in various biomedical research fields."
Pine bark extract (Pycnogenol®) suppresses cigarette smoke-induced fibrotic response via transforming growth factor-β1/Smad family member 2/3 signaling,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) is an important disease featured as intense inflammation, protease imbalance, and air flow limitation and mainly induced by cigarette smoke (CS). In present study, we explored the effects of Pycnogenol® (PYC, pine bark extract) on pulmonary fibrosis caused by CS+lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Mice were treated with LPS intranasally on day 12 and 26, followed by CS exposure for 1 h/day (8 cigarettes per day) for 4 weeks. One hour before CS exposure, 10 and 20 mg/kg of PYC were administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. PYC effectively reduced the number of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory mediators caused by CS+LPS exposure in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. PYC inhibited the collagen deposition on lung tissue caused by CS+LPS exposure, as evidenced by Masson’s trichrome stain. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression and Smad family member 2/3 (Smad 2/3) phosphorylation were effectively suppressed by PYC treatment. PYC markedly reduced the collagen deposition caused by CS+LPS exposure, which was closely involved in TGF-β1/Smad 2/3 signaling, which is associated with pulmonary fibrotic change. These findings suggest that treatment with PYC could be a therapeutic strategy for controlling COPD progression."
Antibacterial activity of essential oil from lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) against pet turtle-borne pathogenic bacteria,"Pet turtles are well-known to harbor an array of bacterial pathogens which can cause zoonotic infections in humans as well as opportunistic infections in the turtles itself. Essential oils are the natural plant extracts which have been traditionally used for disease treatment. In the present study, the essential oil of lavender (EOL) was examined for its antibacterial activity against thirty-eight strains of turtle-borne pathogenic bacteria belonging to seven species; Aeromonas hydrophila, A. caviae, A. dhakensis, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibacterial activity of EOL was tested by means of disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests. In addition, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of 11 commonly used antimicrobials was examined and the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was calculated. The results revealed that EOL was active against all tested turtle-borne pathogenic bacteria except P. aeruginosa. The range of MIC and MBC values of EOL against isolates except P. aeruginosa were recorded as 0.5–1% (V/V) and 0.5–2% (V/V), respectively. The MBC/MIC ratio was detected as <4, revealing that the tested EOL was bactericidal. Besides, most of the isolates were resistant to different antimicrobials in antimicrobial disk diffusion test. MAR index values of the tested strains were ranging from 0.27 to 0.91. The outcomes indicate that EOL has a potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against pathogenic bacteria isolated from pet turtles."
Effect of ionizing radiation at low dose on transgenerational carcinogenesis by epigenetic regulation,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure of parents on carcinogenesis of the next generation focusing on the epigenetic perspective to clarify the relationship between radiation dose and carcinogenesis in F1 generation SD rats. F1 generations from pregnant rats (F0) who were exposed to gamma rays were divided into three groups according to the dose of radiation: 10 rad, 30 rad, and untreated. They were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg of diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Carcinogenesis was analyzed by examining expression levels of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and other related genes by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). DNA methylation in liver tissues was evaluated to discern epigenetic regulation of transgenerational carcinogenesis vulnerability following IR exposure. Numerous studies have proved that transcriptional inactivation due to hypermethylation of TSG preceded carcinogenesis. Results of this study revealed hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene SOCS1 in group treated with 30 rad. In addition, genes related to DNA damage response pathway (GSTP1, ATM, DGKA, PARP1, and SIRT6) were epigenetically inactivated in all DEN treated groups. In the case of proto-oncogene c-Myc, DNA hypermethylation was identified in the group with low dose of IR (10 rad). Results of this study indicated that each TSG had different radiation threshold level (dose-independent way) and DEN treatment could affect DNA methylation profile irrelevant of ionizing radiation dose."
Cerebral ischemic injury decreases α-synuclein expression in brain tissue and glutamate-exposed HT22 cells,"α-Synuclein is abundantly expressed in neuronal tissue, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, and exerts a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress. Cerebral ischemia causes severe neurological disorders and neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we examined α-synuclein expression in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemic injury and neuronal cells damaged by glutamate treatment. MCAO surgical operation was performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats, and brain samples were isolated 24 hours after MCAO. We confirmed neurological behavior deficit, infarction area, and histopathological changes following MCAO injury. A proteomic approach and Western blot analysis demonstrated a decrease in α-synuclein in the cerebral cortices after MCAO injury. Moreover, glutamate treatment induced neuronal cell death and decreased α-synuclein expression in a hippocampal-derived cell line in a dose-dependent manner. It is known that α-synuclein regulates neuronal survival, and low levels of α-synuclein expression result in cytotoxicity. Thus, these results suggest that cerebral ischemic injury leads to a reduction in α-synuclein and consequently causes serious brain damage."
Evaluation of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity of Angelica acutiloba in a standard battery of assays,"Among three representative species of Angelica found in Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Japan, Angelica acutiloba (AA) has been used as traditional herbal medicine with antitumor, antiinflammatory, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetes activities. In this study, the potential genotoxicity and mutagenicity of the AA extract were examined in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests (bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay, and in vivo micronucleus assay) in accordance with the test guidelines for toxicity testing developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Upon testing in the bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) using five Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537, no significant increase the number of revertant colonies in the metabolic activation system and non-activation system was noted in the AA extract groups. Also, in the chromosome aberration test, the AA extract did not cause chromosomal aberration with or without metabolic activation by S9 mix. A bone marrow micronucleus test of mice demonstrated that the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the AA extract groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg BW) was equivalent to that of the negative control group. Based on these results from a standard battery of assays, the AA extract was concluded to have no genotoxic at the proper dose."
Climate change impact analysis on watershed using QSWAT,"This study focuses on analysis of future climate change impacts on West Nishnabotna Watershed, using climate model data and an open source hydrological model—Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is run in Quantum Geographical Information System(QGIS) environment. The data required to simulate hydrological processes using SWAT plugin in QGIS (QSWAT) are Digital Elevation Model, land use/landcover map, soil map, slope map and climate data of the study area. The required climate parameters like maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation are obtained from North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program climate model database which are bias corrected for the study area using linear scaling method. SWAT model is setup using observed climate and the model calibration and validation is performed using SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP). Simulations are run for historic (1971–1999) and future (2041–2069) climate conditions for the stream flow prediction. The climate change impact analysis like anomalies and trends in the hydrological regime of the watershed are carried out based on QSWAT simulation results."
Everything you always wanted to know about SDPD⋆ (⋆but were afraid to ask),"An overview of the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) method is presented in a format that tries to quickly answer questions that often arise among users and newcomers. It is hoped that the status of SDPD is clarified as a mesoscopic particle model and its potentials and limitations are highlighted, as compared with other methods."
Modeling biomembranes and red blood cells by coarse-grained particle methods,"In this work, the previously developed coarse-grained (CG) particle models for biomembranes and red blood cells (RBCs) are reviewed, and the advantages of the CG particle methods over the continuum and atomistic simulations for modeling biological phenomena are discussed. CG particle models can largely increase the length scale and time scale of atomistic simulations by eliminating the fast degrees of freedom while preserving the mesoscopic structures and properties of the simulated system. Moreover, CG particle models can be used to capture the microstructural alternations in diseased RBCs and simulate the topological changes of biomembranes and RBCs, which are the major challenges to the typical continuum representations of membranes and RBCs. The power and versatility of CG particle methods are demonstrated through simulating the dynamical processes involving significant topological changes, e.g., lipid self-assembly vesicle fusion and membrane budding."
Stable and accurate schemes for smoothed dissipative particle dynamics,"Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) is a mesoscopic particle method that allows to select the level of resolution at which a fluid is simulated. The numerical integration of its equations of motion still suffers from the lack of numerical schemes satisfying all the desired properties such as energy conservation and stability. Similarities between SDPD and dissipative particle dynamics with energy (DPDE) conservation, which is another coarse-grained model, enable adaptation of recent numerical schemes developed for DPDE to the SDPD setting. In this article, a Metropolis step in the integration of the fluctuation/dissipation part of SDPD is introduced to improve its stability."
Synergistic Effects of Carbon Nanotube/Nano-MoS2 Hybrid on Tribological Performance of Polyimide Nanocomposite Films,"Modified carbon nanotube/nano-MoS2 (CMS) hybrid as a self-lubricating and anti-wear nanofiller was prepared through chemical compounding and then incorporated into polyimide (PI) matrix to yield CMS/PI composite by in situ polymerization.

With only 0.5 wt% addition of CMS, the friction coefficient and wear rate of CMS/PI composite decreased by 31 and 84%, respectively, compared to virgin PI. The results showed that the combinational structure of CMS hybrid, as CNT-coated few-layer MoS2 nanosheet, which took the advantage of both CNT and nano-MoS2, contributed to the synergistic effect on the tribological properties."

Brewing beer in wine country? First archaeobotanical indications for beer making in Early and Middle Bronze Age Greece,"This paper revisits and old question “Beer or wine?” as regards the potential alcoholic drinks consumed by prehistoric societies in southeastern Europe. Archaeobotanical remains of sprouted cereal grains as well as cereal fragments from the Bronze Age sites of Archondiko and Argissa on mainland Greece, presented here for the first time, provide strong indications for the making of something similar to beer in late 3rd millennium bc Greece, opening up a series of new questions about the recipes followed in this process and their origins. Beyond the recipes themselves, the paper highlights a range of available options as regards alcoholic drinks in Bronze Age Greece, beer and wine, offering thus a more detailed approach to preferences and possible identities reflected in the choice of alcoholic drink among prehistoric societies inhabiting the southernmost tip of the Balkan Peninsula, the Aegean and mainland Greece."
Increased precipitation modulates the influence of nitrogen and litter inputs on the nutrient resorption proficiency rather than efficiency of Leymus chinensis,"Resorption of nutrients from senescing organs is an important conservation mechanism that is usually influenced by the supply of soil nutrients and plant growth requirements. Therefore, it is likely that increases in nitrogen (N), precipitation, and litter could lead to changes in nutrient resorption because of changes in nutrients in the soil and accelerated plant growth in response to the alleviation of water limitations in arid and semiarid environments. In the current study, we investigated the effects of water, N, and litter addition on the nutrient resorption efficiency and proficiency of N and phosphorus (P) in leaves and stems of Leymus chinensis in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results showed that N addition significantly decreased the N resorption efficiency in leaves under water addition, and increased P resorption efficiency under ambient precipitation conditions. There was no apparent influence of either litter or water addition on N and P resorption efficiencies. However, N and litter addition significantly altered N and P resorption proficiencies, and these effects were modulated by water availability. Furthermore, changes in resorption proficiencies were mainly associated with alterations in the nutritional status of green organs in response to water, N and litter addition, except for leaf P. Our findings highlight the importance of increased precipitation in modulating the nutrient resorption proficiency of plants under potentially increased nutrient availability in semiarid grasslands. Therefore, global changes in precipitation and N, and corresponding litter changes could result in complex effects on plant nutrient economies and, in turn, could influence the return of nutrients to the soil."
Does heavy metal exposure affect the condition of Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) nestlings?,"Anthropogenic pollution results in high concentrations of heavy metals in the environment. Due to their persistence and a high potential for bioaccumulation, metals are a real threat for birds breeding in industrial areas. The aim of the present study has been to explore the contents of heavy metals (arsenic As, cadmium Cd, chromium Cr, copper Cu, iron Fe, nickel Ni, lead Pb and zinc Zn) in the excreta of Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) nestlings living in polluted environment and to investigate the relationship between these contents and the nestlings’ condition. Excrement samples contained all the studied elements. The contents of arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc in the excreta of nestlings from nests located close to a slag dump were several times higher than in the soil near the dump, which suggested accumulation in food consumed by the birds. Condition parameters (body mass and haemoglobin concentration) were not related to heavy metal concentrations in the nestlings’ excreta, except of Zn. It is possible that Whitethroats are able to detoxicate heavy metals to a certain extent. Detailed, multi-element analysis of the environment, food and bird tissues or excreta should be performed to explore relations between different chemicals and bird condition."
"Effects of dissolved organic matter, feeding, and water flow on the bioconcentration of diclofenac in crucian carp (Carassius auratus)","Diclofenac (DCF), a prevalent anti-inflammatory drug, is frequently detected in aquatic organisms. However, little is known about the environmental factors that affect the bioconcentration of DCF in aquatic environments. Here, we firstly investigated the bioconcentration of DCF by crucian carp (Carassius auratus) following aqueous exposure (3.57, 14.5, and 71.8 μg L−1) for 21 days. DCF can accumulate in crucian carp, and the maximum bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 121 L kg−1 in the liver, 52.3 L kg−1 in the gills, and 46.8 L kg−1 in the muscle were always found at 3.57 μg L−1 after 14 days of exposure. Secondly, the influences of dissolved organic matter (DOM), feeding, and water flow on the bioconcentration of DCF were determined at the nominal concentration of 4 μg L−1 for 14 days. The BCFs of DCF in various fish tissues decreased by 0.5–85% with the increasing DOM concentrations. Feeding also led to lower body burden of DCF in fish tissues (6–55%) with the increasing food amount. In hydrodynamic experiment, the BCFs of DCF decreased by15–57% at most in various fish tissues. Collectively, our results demonstrated the bioconcentration of DCF in fish can be influenced by various environmental factors, which should be considered in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals."
Removal of macro-pollutants in oily wastewater obtained from soil remediation plant using electro-oxidation process,"Electro-oxidation process by niobium boron-doped diamond (Nb/BDD) electrode was used to treat non-biodegradable oily wastewater provided from soil leachate contaminated by hydrocarbons. Firstly, the diffusion current limit and mass transfer coefficient was experimentally measured (7.1 mA cm−2 and 14.7 μm s−1, respectively), in order to understand minimum applied current density. Later on, the oxidation kinetic model of each pollutant was investigated in different current densities ranged between 3.8 and 61.5 mA cm−2. It was observed that direct oxidation was the main removal mechanism of organic and inorganic carbon, while the indirect oxidation in higher current density was responsible for nitrogen oxidation. Hydrocarbon in the form of colloidal particles could be removed by electro-flotation. On the other hand, electro-decomposition on the surface of cathode and precipitation by hydroxyl ions were the utmost removal pathway of metals. According to the initial experiments, operating condition was further optimized by central composite design model in different current density, treatment time, and electrolyte addition, based on the best responses on the specific energy consumption (SEC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency. Unde r optimum operating condition (current density = 23.1 mA cm−2, time = 120 min, Ti/Pt as a cathode, and Nb/BDD as the anode), electro-oxidation showed the following removal efficiencies: COD (84.6%), TOC (68.2%), oil and grease (99%), color (87.9%), total alkalinity (92%), Ntot (18%), NH4+ (31%), Ca (66.4%), Fe (71.1%), Mg (41.4%), Mn (78.1%), Ptot (75%), S (67.1%), and Si (19.1%)."
"Nano-formulation for topical treatment of precancerous lesions: skin penetration, in vitro, and in vivo toxicological evaluation","With the aim of improving the topical delivery of the antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU), it was loaded into ultradeformable liposomes composed of soy phosphatidylcholine and sodium cholate (UDL-5FU). The liposome populations had a mean size of 70 nm without significant changes in 56 days, and the ultradeformable formulations were up to 324-fold more elastic than conventional liposomes. The interaction between 5FU and the liposomal membrane was studied by three methods, and also release profile was obtained. UDL-5FU did penetrate the stratum corneum of human skin. At in vitro experiments, the formulation was more toxic on a human melanoma-derived than on a human keratinocyte-derived cell line. Cells captured liposomes by metabolically active processes. In vivo toxicity experiments were carried out in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae by studying the swimming activity, morphological changes, and alterations in the heart rate after incubation. UDL-5FU was more toxic than free 5FU. Therefore, this nano-formulation could be useful for topical application in deep skin precancerous lesions with advantages over current treatments. This is the first work that assessed the induction of apoptosis, skin penetration in a Saarbrücken penetration model, and the toxicological effects in vivo of an ultradeformable 5FU-loaded formulation."
Variability of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic function and clinical heterogeneity in a dopa-responsive dystonia family with GCH-1 gene mutation,"We studied the presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic function using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of a 99mTc-TRODAT-1 (TRODAT) scan in a dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) family with the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH-1) gene mutation. Clinically, there was presentation of intrafamilial variability in the DRD family. The index patient was a 10-year-old girl with classic DRD and normal presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic function. However, her grandmother, a 79-year-old woman, presented with slowly progressive Parkinson’s disease (PD) without dystonic symptoms and excellent response to dopaminergic therapy for 21 years. Her brain TRODAT SPECT imaging revealed a markedly and asymmetrically reduced uptake of dopamine transporter at the bilateral striatum. Her father, a 54-year-old man, was an asymptomatic gene carrier and his brain TRODAT SPECT imaging revealed asymmetrically reduced nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission in the bilateral striatum. We conclude variability of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in patients with DRD is related to their clinical heterogeneity. Significantly, impairment of presynaptic dopamine function actually occurs in the asymptomatic gene carrier."
Weight bearing exercise can elicit similar peak muscle activation as medium–high intensity resistance exercise in elderly women,To assess whether stepping-based weight bearing exercise (WBE) can elicit peak activation of upper leg muscles similar to resistance exercise (RE) at an intensity required to induce strength gains in elderly women.
Is the Problem of Population Aging Real? An Answer Obtained from the Labor Force Participation of the G7 Countries,"Old-age dependency ratio (OADR) is commonly used to indicate the financial burden of population aging; increases in OADR have caused widespread concerns. To better measure the financial burden, this paper proposes a dependency ratio of non-labor-force population to labor-force population (NLDR). This ratio includes OADR as a special case. This paper finds that, when measured by NLDR, financial burden actually declined in five of the G7 countries during the years 2000–2014. To project future trends, labor force participation rates by age f(x) can be forecasted using the coherent Lee-Carter method. This paper combines the forecasted f(x) and the population projections of the United Nations, to forecast increases of NLDR for the G7 countries between 2014 and 2050. These increases are on average less than one-fifth of the increases projected for OADR. Because OADR ignores the increase of labor force participation, its description of the problem of population aging for the G7 countries in the past is unrealistic and inaccurate, and forecasts of the future based on OADR are likely to be just as unrealistic. Understanding the conditions and reasons for increases in labor force participation can provide valuable insights into the issues of population aging in China, where the remarkable increase of OADR may result in real financial burdens. One condition for labor force participation to increase could be that people remain in good health, which makes continuing to work more feasible. Other reasons for labor force participation to increase are likely to be found in government policies that encourage people to continue working longer. For China, collecting reliable data on labor force participation is also crucial. Without these data, the effects of the policies that encourage people to continue working longer cannot be detected; and therefore the policies cannot be properly developed."
Hukou-Restricted Migration and Migrants’ Health: Evidence and Policy Implication,"Since the 1980s, rapid economic development in China has continued to attract great numbers of migrants from rural to urban labor markets. As a result, the constraints of the hukou registration system on migration flows have gradually declined. Nevertheless, institutional barriers associated with the hukou remain for migrants in their social integration in destination. And these have led to substantial negative impacts on migrants’ physical, social and psychological wellbeing."
"Autonomy, Competence and Non-interference","In light of the variety of uses of the term autonomy in recent bioethics literature, in this paper, I suggest that competence, not being as contested, is better placed to play the anti-paternalistic role currently assigned to autonomy. The demonstration of competence, I will argue, can provide individuals with robust spheres of non-interference in which they can pursue their lives in accordance with their own values. This protection from paternalism is achieved by granting individuals rights to non-interference upon demonstration of competence. In this paper, I present a risk-sensitive account of competence as a means of grounding rights to non-interference. On a risk-sensitive account of competence individuals demonstrate their competence by exercising three capacities to the extent necessary to meet a threshold determined by the riskiness of the decision. These three capacities are the capacity to (i) acquire knowledge, (ii) use instrumental rationality, and (iii) form and revise a life plan."
A hybrid optimization strategy for registering images with large local deformations and intensity variations,To develop a method for intra-patient registration of pre- and post-contrast abdominal MR images with large local deformations and large intensity variations.
Progression to bone-marrow carcinomatosis and extraosseous legion during treatment with radium-223 for multiple bone metastases,"A 67-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer presented with progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer. After sequential therapies with flutamide, estramustine phosphate, docetaxel, enzalutamide, and cabazitaxel for castration-resistant prostate cancer, radium-223 was initiated and continued up to 4 cycles. However, concurrently with radiological and clinical progressions, pancytopenia was observed due to bone-marrow carcinomatosis by prostatic adenocarcinoma. This case suggested that radium-223 should be employed at appropriated timing before appearances of extraosseous and bone-marrow lesions in addition to visceral metastasis."
Architecture In-Play: Digitally-Driven Kinetic Origami Architecture,"This Letter from the Editor presents an overview of the special issue’s theme, Architecture In-Play, and its focus on digitally enabled, kinetic architecture. The original catalyst for this issue was an international conference on this topic, which was held between the 11th and 23rd of July 2016 at ISCTE–Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal. The Letter from the Editor includes an introduction to the five papers that make up the special issue."
Vineyard microclimate and yield under different plastic covers,"The use of plastic cover in vineyards minimizes effects of adverse weather conditions. The northwest of São Paulo State is one of the largest grape producing regions in Brazil; however, few studies investigate the effects of different plastic covers on vineyards in this region. This study compared the effect of black shading screen (BSS) and braided polypropylene film (BPF) on BRS Morena vineyard microclimate, grown on an overhead trellis system in the northwestern São Paulo. The experiments were carried out during three growing seasons (2012–2014). BSS allowed superior incoming solar radiation (SR) transmissivity, resulting in higher net radiation (Rn), and higher ratio between photosynthetically active (PAR) and SR. No differences were observed between the average air temperatures (T) and relative humidity (RH) of covered environments (BPF and BSS) and outside condition (automatic weather station–AWS), due to high air circulation, despite wind speed (WS) reduction caused by plastic covers. BPF provided better conditions for vineyard growth with higher fruit yield than vineyard under BSS regarding the number of shoots with bunches per plant, bunch and stem weights, longitudinal diameter of berries, quantity of fertile buds per shoot, and yield per shoot and per plant. BPF covers also influenced leaf size and growth speed of plants in vineyards."
Challenges of using air conditioning in an increasingly hot climate,"At present, air conditioning (AC) is the most effective means for the cooling of indoor space. However, its increased global use is problematic for various reasons. This paper explores the challenges linked to increased AC use and discusses more sustainable alternatives. A literature review was conducted applying a transdisciplinary approach. It was further complemented by examples from cities in hot climates. To analyse the findings, an analytical framework was developed which considers four societal levels—individual, community, city, and national. The main challenges identified from the literature review are as follows: environmental, organisational, socio-economical, biophysical and behavioural. The paper also identifies several measures that could be taken to reduce the fast growth of AC use. However, due to the complex nature of the problem, there is no single solution to provide sustainable cooling. Alternative solutions were categorised in three broad categories: climate-sensitive urban planning and building design, alternative cooling technologies, and climate-sensitive attitudes and behaviour. The main findings concern the problems arising from leaving the responsibility to come up with cooling solutions entirely to the individual, and how different societal levels can work towards more sustainable cooling options. It is concluded that there is a need for a more holistic view both when it comes to combining various solutions as well as involving various levels in society."
A new method of speech transmission over space time block coded co-operative MIMO–OFDM networks using time and space diversity,"Reliable and good quality of service for speech transmission over wireless network has been a major challenge for the communication engineers and researchers. In this paper a new technique of speech compression and transmission using different Daubechies wavelets in a space time block coded co-corporative MIMO–OFDM networks using time and space diversity has been proposed. The main focus has been laid on design and development of wavelet based compression of multimedia signals for cooperative MIMO–OFDM system. We tried to find out various major issues regarding the wavelet compression of a speech signal. These issues include choice of a wavelet, decomposition level and thresholding criteria suitable for speech compression and transmission in co-operative MIMO–OFDM systems. A wavelet based speech compression technique using hard and soft thresholding algorithm has been proposed. The work shows that wavelet compression with QPSK modulation is a promising compression technique in a cooperative MIMO–OFDM system which makes use of the elegant theory of wavelets. The performance has been evaluated using mean square error, peak signal to noise ratio, compression ratio, bit error rate, and retained signal energy. It has been found that the transmitted speech signal is retrieved well under noisy conditions at higher order Daubechies wavelets. From the results it is clear that proposed technique aims at a radio access technology that can provide service performance comparable to that of current fixed Line accesses. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, various performance parameters have been compared with previously implemented techniques and it has been found that the proposed work shows better performance as compared to the already existing techniques."
Using maximum likelihood to derive various distance-based goodness-of-fit indicators for hydrologic modeling assessment,"Currently used goodness-of-fit (GOF) indicators (i.e. efficiency criteria) are largely empirical and different GOF indicators emphasize different aspects of model performance; a thorough assessment of model skill may require the use of robust skill matrices. In this study, based on the maximum likelihood method, a statistical measure termed BC-GED error model is proposed, which firstly uses the Box–Cox (BC) transformation method to remove the heteroscedasticity of model residuals, and then employs the generalized error distribution (GED) with zero-mean to fit the distribution of model residuals after BC transformation. Various distance-based GOF indicators can be explicitly expressed by the BC-GED error model for different values of the BC transformation parameter λ and GED kurtosis coefficient β. Our study proves that (1) the shape of error distribution implied in the GOF indicators affects the model performance on high or low flow discharges because large error-power (β) value can cause low probability of large residuals and small β value will lead to high probability of zero value; (2) the mean absolute error could balance consideration of low and high flow value as its assumed error distribution (i.e. Laplace distribution, where β = 1) is the turning point of GED derivative at zero value. The results of a study performed in the Baocun watershed via comparison of the SWAT model-calibration results using six distance-based GOF indicators show that even though the formal BC-GED is theoretically reasonable, the calibrated model parameters do not always correspond to high performance of model-simulation results because of imperfection of the hydrologic model. However, the derived distance-based GOF indicators using the maximum likelihood method offer an easy way of choosing GOF indicators for different study purposes and developing multi-objective calibration strategies."
"The 8 September 2017 Tsunami Triggered by the
                Mw 8.2 Intraplate
            Earthquake, Chiapas, Mexico","The 8 September 2017, Mw 8.2 earthquake offshore Chiapas, Mexico,
                is the largest earthquake in recorded history in Chiapas since 1902. It caused
                damage in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas and Tabasco, including more than 100
                fatalities, over 1.5 million people were affected, and 41,000 homes were damaged in
                the state of Chiapas alone. This earthquake, an intraplate event on a normal fault
                on the oceanic subducting plate, generated a tsunami recorded at several tide gauge
                stations in Mexico and on the Pacific Ocean. Here, we report the physical effects of
                the tsunami on the Chiapas coast and analyze the societal implications of this
                tsunami on the basis of our post-tsunami field survey. The associated tsunami waves
                were recorded first at Huatulco tide gauge station at 5:04 (GMT) 12 min after the
                earthquake. We covered ground observations along 41 km of the coast of Chiapas,
                encompassing the sites with the highest projected wave heights based on
                our preliminary tsunami model (maximum tsunami amplitudes between 94.5° and 93.0°W).
                Runup and inundation distances were measured along eight sites. The tsunami occurred
                at low tide. The maximum runup was ~ 3 m at Boca del Cielo, and maximum inundation
                distance was 190 m in Puerto Arista, corresponding to the coast in front of the
                epicenter and in the central sector of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Tsunami scour and
                erosion was evident along the Chiapas coast. Tsunami deposits, mainly sand, reached
                up to 32 cm thickness thinning landward up to 172 m distance."
Application of electron beam irradiation for improving the microbial quality of processed laver products and luminescence detection of irradiated lavers,"The laver (Porphyra spp.) is normally processed in three kinds of products: dried laver (DL), roasted laver (RL), and seasoned roasted laver (SL). This work evaluated the effects of electron beam (E-beam) irradiation at different doses (0, 1, 4, 7, and 10 kGy) on microbiological and physicochemical qualities and detection characteristics of irradiated samples by luminescence analysis. E-beam irradiation resulted in dose-dependent microbial reductions, showing that 1 kGy destroyed initial coliforms (< 2.35 log CFU/g) to undetectable levels (< 10 CFU/g), while 7 kGy (approved dose for seaweed in Korea Food Code) reduced total aerobic bacteria (3.72–6.33 log CFU/g) and yeasts and molds (2.05–4.98 log CFU/g) by about 2 log cycles. Chlorophyll content remained unaffected in irradiated samples as compared to control; however, carotenoids content and Hunter’s b values (degree of yellowness) showed a tendency to decrease in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). However, E-beam irradiation less than 7 kGy did not significantly affect sensory properties of the processed laver products. Irradiated laver products (DL, RL, and SL) could be screened and detected by analyzing photostimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence, respectively, from the non-irradiated ones. The overall results indicated that E-beam irradiation is effective for ensuring the improved microbial quality (< 4 log CFU/g) for the exporting processed laver products without apparent quality changes."
Compiler Optimization of Accelerator Data Transfers,"Accelerators such as GPUs, FPGAs, and many-core processors can provide significant performance improvements, but their effectiveness is dependent upon the skill of programmers to manage their complex architectures. One area of difficulty is determining which data to transfer on and off of the accelerator and when. Poorly placed data transfers can result in overheads that completely dwarf the benefits of using accelerators. To know what data to transfer, and when, the programmer must understand the data-flow of the transferred memory locations throughout the program, and how the accelerator region fits into the program as a whole. We argue that compilers should take on the responsibility of data transfer scheduling, thereby reducing the demands on the programmer, and resulting in improved program performance and program efficiency from the reduction in the number of bytes transferred. We show that by performing whole-program transfer scheduling on accelerator data transfers we are able to automatically eliminate up to 99% of the bytes transferred to and from the accelerator compared to transfering all data immediately before and after kernel execution for all data involved. The analysis and optimization are language and accelerator-agnostic, but for our examples and testing they have been implemented into an OpenMP to LLVM-IR to CUDA workflow."
Parallel Heat Kernel Volume Based Local Binary Pattern on Multi-Orientation Planes for Face Representation,"Appropriate representation is one of the keys to successful face recognition technologies. Actual facial appearance sometimes differs dramatically because of variations in pose, illumination, expression, and occlusion. However, existing face representation methods remain insufficiently powerful and robust. Hence, we propose a new feature extraction approach for face representation based on heat kernel volume and local binary patterns. Multi-scale heat kernel faces are created in our proposed framework. We then reformulate these multi-scale heat kernel faces as three-dimensional volume. Furthermore, we generate multi-orientation planes from the heat kernel volume, which reflects orientation co-occurrence statistics among different heat kernel faces. Finally, we apply local binary pattern (LBP) analysis on the multi-orientation planes of the heat kernel volume to capture the microstructure and macrostructure of face appearance. Hence, we obtain the heat kernel volume based local binary pattern on multi-orientation planes (HKV–LBP–MOP) descriptor. The proposed method is successfully be paralleled. We applied the method to face recognition and obtain the performance of 99.28 and 87.82% on ORL and Yale databases respectively. Experimental results on the show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other well-known approaches in terms of recognition rate."
A Real-Time Data Mining Approach for Interaction Analytics Assessment: IoT Based Student Interaction Framework,"Students’ interaction and collaboration with the fellows and teachers using the Internet of Things (IoT) based interoperable infrastructure is a convenient way. Measuring student attention is an essential part of the educational assessment for students’ interaction. As new learning styles develop, new tools and assessment methods are also needed. The focus in this paper is to develop IoT based interaction framework and analysis of the student experience in electronic learning (eLearning) so that the students can take full advantage of the modern interaction technology and their learning can increase to a high level. This setup has a data collection module, which is implemented using Visual C# programming language and computer vision library. The number of faces, number of eyes, and status of eyes are extracted from the video stream, which is taken from a video camera. The extracted information is saved in a dataset for further analysis. The analysis of the dataset produces interesting results for student learning assessments. Modern learning management systems can integrate the developed tool to consider student-learning behaviors when assessing electronic learning strategies. The tools are also developed for the data collection on both student and teacher ends. Correlation of data and hidden meaning are extracted to make the learning experience and teaching performance better and adaptable. IoT based infrastructure provides the facilities to fellow students about location awareness, fellows’ accessibility, social behavior and helping hand."
A group decision process based on expert analysis and criteria coalition to measure municipalities’ financial distress,"The aim of this work is to propose a new operating model to evaluate municipalities’ financial distress, based on the analysis of experts and the synergies between the variables that are evaluated in the process. For such purpose, the methodology of decision-making in multi-criteria group will be used, which is implemented by combining the hierarchical analytic process, the Choquet integral, the majority operator, and linguistic information. This new model has been applied to a sample of 120 Spanish municipalities and has allowed the assessment of their financial situation in a powerful manner using a set of variables corresponding to the year 2015. Given the flexibility of the proposed model, the above-mentioned application could be useful for assessing the financial capacity of municipalities in any international context."
Study of variability performance of CMOS active inductors,"The development of CMOS technology has led to the integration of communication circuits on a single chip. Inductors constitute an essential part of a RF front ends. Employment of spiral inductors has put several limitations on such RF circuits. Spiral inductors are fixed, bulky, cover large area and can’t be scaled with the process technologies. Also, due to the resistive losses and substrate losses, the quality factor is limited. An alternate way to emulate inductor behavior is using active inductors. Active inductors are area-efficient, support tunable inductance, quality factor, self-resonant frequency and can be scaled with process technologies. However, the active inductors are too sensitive to process, supply voltage and temperature variations. In this paper, four active inductor architectures i.e. basic, resistive feedback, Weng-Kuo and regulated cascode active inductor are designed. The quality factor performance of the four active inductor circuits is evaluated. Further, to demonstrate the performance of active inductors, bandpass filter configurations are implemented. The impact of process, voltage and temperature variations on the quality factor of active inductors and resonant frequency of bandpass filters is studied. Simulations are carried out at 180-nm technology node."
Image classification based on sparse-coded features using sparse coding technique for aerial imagery: a hybrid dictionary approach,"This work offers an approach to aerial image classification for use in remote sensing object recognition, image processing and computer vision. Sparse coding (SC) is used to classify unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) and satellite images because SC representation can generalize a large dataset and improve the detection of distinctive features by reducing calculation time for feature matching and classification. Features from images are extracted based on the following descriptors: (a) Scale Invariant Feature Transform; (b) Histogram of Oriented Gradients; and (c) Local Binary Patterns. SC representation and local image features are combined to represent global features for classification. Features are deployed in a sparse model to store descriptor features using extant dictionaries such as (a) the Discrete Cosine Transform and (b) the Discrete Wavelet Transform. An additional two dictionaries are proposed as developed for the present work: (c) the Discrete Ridgelet Transform (DRT) and (d) the Discrete Tchebichef Transform. The DRT dictionary is constructed by using the Ricker wavelet function to generate finite Ridgelet transforms as basis elements for a hybrid dictionary. Different pooling methods have also been employed to convert sparse-coded features into a feature matrix. Various machine learning algorithms are then applied to the feature matrix to classify objects contained in UAV and satellite imagery data. Experimental results show that the SC model secured better accuracy rates for extracted discriminative features contained in remote sensing images. The authors concluded that the proposed SC technique and proposed dictionaries provided feasible solutions for image classification and object recognition."
Assessing the Stability and Sustainability of Rock Art Sites: Insight from Southwestern Arizona,"In light of global trends in human population growth and urbanization, burgeoning cultural heritage tourism industries, and climate change, cultural heritage places in nearly every corner of the world are significantly threatened, and will remain so into the foreseeable future. Rock art sites are some of the most imperiled, with their exposed contexts posing unique challenges to conservation. Consequently, effective management of publically accessible rock art sites necessitates a sustainable approach that weighs visitation in regard to cultural significance and site stability. This essay integrates rock art stability and sustainability assessment methodologies at the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site in southwestern Arizona. The study specifically applies the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI) to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic weathering forces impacting the site, and the Heritage Asset Sensitivity Gauge (HASG) to assess site sustainability under existing management practices in relation to current and forecasted rates of visitation. A spatial analysis of aggregated RASI data shows that visitor foot traffic has had some of the most profound impacts to the petroglyphs. Unrestricted access to the site area is also highly correlated with the presence and location of vandalism and graffiti, and visitor-related trampling has adversely affected the site’s surface artifact assemblage. Application of the HASG projects that, while existing management practices are fairly sustainable, they become less so under forecasted increases in visitation. Further, the HASG appraises the site’s cultural significance as outweighing its market appeal, indicating management efforts should prioritize conservation over tourism-related development."
Modulation of the IL-23/IL-17 axis by fenofibrate ameliorates the ovalbumin/lipopolysaccharide-induced airway inflammation and bronchial asthma in rats,"The overlapping between asthmatic subtypes, including both CD4+ T helper (TH)2 and TH17 cells, is found in the natural course of allergic asthma, especially in exacerbations and severe and insensitive forms to steroids, which are in need of new molecular therapies. In the TH2-subset mediated asthma, fenofibrate displays therapeutic promises, besides evidenced therapeutic effects on TH17-mediated colitis and myocarditis. Therefore, the effects of fenofibrate versus dexamethasone on IL-23/IL-17 axis in ovalbumin (OVA)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway inflammation and bronchial asthma in rats were explored. The OVA/LPS sensitization and challenge were performed for 28 days in male Wistar rats. After sensitization, fenofibrate (100 mg/kg/day) or dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered from the day 15 to 28. Either fenofibrate or dexamethasone attenuated the severity of OVA/LPS-induced airway inflammation and bronchial asthma through significant ameliorations in the total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E assay; the total and differential leukocytic counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; the lung inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-17, and IL-23, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α levels; and the lung IL-17 and IL-23 expressions. In addition to the reduction in the inflammatory and fibrotic histopathological scores, fenofibrate significantly ameliorated the BAL neutrophilic count and the lung IL-17 and IL-23 expressions in comparison to dexamethasone. The suppression of IL-23/IL-17 axis could be considered a molecular therapeutic target for fenofibrate in OVA/LPS-induced airway inflammation and bronchial asthma. Combined therapeutic regimens of fenofibrate and steroids should be furtherly investigated in severe and resistant asthma."
Pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine during analgosedation in ICU patients,"Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a fairly new alfa2-agonist which has been increasingly used in recent years for analgosedation, mostly because it offers a unique ability of providing both moderate level of sedation and analgesia without respiratory depression. Despite of many papers published, there are still only a few concerning the PK of the drug given as long-term infusion in ICU patients. The aim of this work was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine and to investigate the potential benefits of individualization of drug dosing based on patient characteristics in the heterogeneous group of medical and surgical patients staying in intensive care unit. This study was performed in the group of 17 males and 10 females patients with a median age of 59.5 years and median body weight of 75 kg. Blood samples for dexmedetomidine assay were collected from arterial catheter, during and after discontinuation of a standard infusion, that ranged from 24 to 102 h. The following covariates were examined to influence dexmedetomidine PK: age, sex, body weight, patients’ health status described by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), inotropes usage, and infusion duration. The dexmedetomidine PK was best described by a two-compartment model. The typical values of PK parameters were estimated as 27 L for the volume of the central compartment, 87.6 L for the volume of the peripheral compartment, 38.5 L/h (9.2 mL/min/kg for a 70 kg patient) for systemic clearance and 46.4 L/h for the distribution clearance. Those values are consistent with literature findings. We were unable to show any significant relationship between collected covariates and dexmedetomidine PK. This study does not provide sufficient evidence to support the individualization of dexmedetomidine dosing based on age, sex, body weight, SOFA, and infusion duration."
Investigating neutron back scattering technique for the detection of oil water separation levels in horizontal gravity oil separators,Neutron backscattering technique is investigated as an alternative way for measuring the level of water in the horizontal oil gravity separators. This study proposes adding boron of 350 mg/L to the water inside the separator to increase the relative oil to water count rate. A concept design for the injection system is performed with recycling of boron. A CFD model is constructed using ANSYS Fluent software to simulate the boron injection and withdrawal processes. Experiments are conducted parallel to MCNP calculations to investigate the effect on the backscatted neutrons when adding 350 mg/L boron to the water.
Multi-classifier ensemble based on dynamic weights,"In this study, a novel multi-classifier ensemble method based on dynamic weights is proposed to reduce the interference of unreliable decision information and improve the accuracy of fusion decision. The algorithm defines decision credibility to describe the real-time importance of the classifier to the current target, combines this credibility with the reliability calculated by the classifier on the training data set and dynamically assigns the fusion weight to the classifier. Compared with other methods, the contribution of different classifiers to fusion decision in acquiring weights is fully evaluated in consideration of the capability of the classifier to not only identify different sample regions but also output decision information when identifying specific targets. Experimental results on public face databases show that the proposed method can obtain higher classification accuracy than that of single classifier and some popular fusion algorithms. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified."
Further exploration of the SUPPS-P impulsive behavior scale’s factor structure: Evidence from a large Hungarian sample,"Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct playing a pervasive role in psychiatry and neuropsychology. Lynam et al. (2006) have developed the 59-item UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, which assesses five distinct impulsivity dimensions: positive urgency, negative urgency, lack of perseverance, lack of premeditation, and sensation seeking. The short, 20-item version of the UPPS-P (SUPPS-P; Billieux et al. Comprehensive Psychiatry, 53(5), 609–615, 2012) has been developed and adapted into several languages, including English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Arabic. The aim of the present study was to test four theoretical models of the SUPPS-P in a large sample of Hungarian adults. A total of 15,703 participants (64.76% male; Mage = 33.42 years, SD = 11.06) completed the SUPPS-P using an online questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses corroborated the first-order five-factor model of impulsivity and a hierarchical model representing three higher-order constructs (urgency, lack of conscientiousness, sensation seeking), whereas the one-factor and three-factor model were not supported. The factor structure of the SUPPS-P preserved the original, theory-driven structure of the UPPS-P model and this instrument demonstrated good internal consistency. Hypersexual behavior consequences were positively associated with most SUPPS-P components, thus criterion validity was also supported. The SUPPS-P had strong psychometric properties that reflected the theoretical structure of the original UPPS-P model, thus it constitutes a theoretically grounded and time saving multidimensional instrument for assessing impulsivity."
Scalar and vector multipole and vortex solitons in the spatially modulated cubic–quintic nonlinear media,"We derive scalar and vector multipole and vortex soliton solutions in the spatially modulated cubic–quintic nonlinear media, which is governed by a (3+1)-dimensional N-coupled cubic–quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with spatially modulated nonlinearity and transverse modulation. If the modulation depth \(q=1\), the vortex soliton is constructed, and if \(q=0\), the multipole soliton, including dipole, quadrupole, hexapole, octopole and dodecagon solitons, is constructed, respectively, when the topological charge \(k=1\)–5. If the topological charge \(k=0\), scalar solitons can be obtained. Moreover, the number of layers for the scalar and vector multipole and vortex solitons is decided by the value of the soliton order number n."
Spatial Cournot Competition in a Circular City with More than Two Dispatches,"This paper investigates spatial Cournot competition in a circular city, where the maximal service range of a vehicle is less than half of the perimeter, and a firm needs to initiate more than two dispatches to serve the whole market. We examine a multi-stage game of location and transportation mode choices, and the subsequent quantity competition between duopoly firms. The findings reveal that non-maximum dispersion is the unique location equilibrium when duopoly firms deliver products in different transportation modes or when the transportation mode decisions are made endogenously and the fixed cost of a transportation instrument is relatively high."
"Agency Contracts, Noncommitment Timing Strategies and Real Options","Given that an owner lacks the ability to commit to his or her timing decisions under a manager’s hidden action, we consider the optimal design of the contract and the owner’s optimal timing decisions. Using a real options approach, we show that, compared with the full commitment case, a higher (lower)-quality project is launched later than (at the same time as) the first-best case, whereas the replacement of the manager is (is not necessarily) made later if the hidden-action problem is severe enough (is not severe enough). Severance pay may serve to minimize the compensation for the manager’s loss of corporate control."
Template in situ inducing dispersion of nickel on SBA-15 for methane reforming with carbon dioxide,"Highly dispersed Ni/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared via template extraction with varying different extraction times (Ni/S-x, x = 0.5, 3.5, 6.5 h) for methane reforming with carbon dioxide. Based on the various characterization results and initial activity evaluation, Ni/S-3.5 h catalyst showed the best catalytic performance. Compared with the catalyst prepared via template calcination (Ni-S), Ni/S-3.5 h catalyst held steady with CH4 and CO2 conversions while those of the Ni-S catalyst respectively decreased by 15 and 11% during the long-term stability test at 700 °C for 50 h. As TEM and TG–DSC results confirmed, Ni particles in spent Ni/S-3.5 h catalyst stayed well-dispersed with size slightly increasing from an initial 3.9–4.1 nm and nearly no carbon deposition was observed. On the contrary, Ni-S catalyst was subjected to sintered metal particles (increased from 11.6 to 18 nm) and formed carbon fibers. The prominent resistance to sintering and coking over stable Ni/S-3.5 h catalyst was attributed to the high dispersion and strengthened metal-support interaction induced via the residual in situ templates."
Do Local Property Taxes Affect New Building Development? Results from a Quasi-Natural Experiment in New Zealand,"We utilise a quasi-natural experiment in local property tax reform arising from a compulsory amalgamation of several local councils in 2010 in Auckland, New Zealand, to form a unitary local authority. The reform involved changes in property taxes (known as ‘Rates’ in New Zealand) including a shift in the local tax base from land-value to capital-value in some of the former councils; changes in relative levels of Rates across former councils; and changes in levels of a separate tax (Development Contributions) levied on new building. These exogenously imposed reforms enable us to test several hypotheses related to the effects on property development of these tax switches using a difference-in-difference approach, controlling for other influences. We find support for tax effects on building alterations but no evidence of effects on new building development after amalgamation. Our dataset covers only two post-amalgamation years, and we speculate that this apparent difference may arise from greater flexibility of building alterations to respond quickly compared with new developments."
Study of a supramolecular structure of continental type petroleum asphaltenes,"Supramolecular, electronic, and chemical structures of petroleum asphaltene molecules are studied. The investigations are carried out by quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics methods. The quantum chemical calculation of the structure-chemical parameters of dimers and trimers of petroleum asphaltenes is made using DFT/B3LYP. The refined values of the ionization potential and electron affinity of petroleum asphaltene molecules, their dimers and trimers agree well with the electron spectroscopy data. The results of the study of geometric structures of petroleum asphaltene dimers and trimers confirm the non-planar structure of asphaltenes."
"[NiEn3]CrO4: Structure, thermal properties, and pseudomorphism","The crystal structure of [NiEn3]CrO4 (En is ethylendiamine), C6H24CrN6NiO4 is studied: a = 9.0408(5) Å, c = 9.7466(4) Å, V = 689.92(8) Å3, space group P63/mmc, Z = 2, d
x
 = 1.704 g/cm3, Ni–N 2.133(9) Å, ∠N–Ni–N 82.4(5)°. The thermal properties are determined. When it is heated in a hydrogen atmosphere, a mixture of nanocrystalline Ni and Cr2O3 powders with coherent scattering regions of 59 nm and 90 nm respectively is formed. It is demonstrated that thermal decomposition products consist of pseudomorphic particles that inherit the sizes and shapes of initial [NiEn3]CrO4 single crystals."
"Crystal structure and thermal properties of N,N′-(2,2-dimethylpropylene)-bis(acetylacetoneiminato)palladium(II)","[Pd(acacdmpda)] complex (1) is obtained for the first time by the interaction of [Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2], NaOH, and H2acacdmpda (acacdmpda = N,N′-(2,2-dimethylpropylene)-bis(acetylacetoneiminato-)) in acetonitrile. The compound is characterized by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy; its structure is determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 has a molecular structure. The coordination environment of the Pd2+ cation is a distorted square formed by O and N atoms of the tetradentately coordinated acacdmpda2– ligand. The average Pd–O and Pd–N bond lengths are 1.998(4) Å and 2.016(4) Å respectively. The N–Pd–O chelate angles are 92.34(10)° and 91.73(9)°; the N–Pd–N angle is 95.52(10)°.

Structure of a gadolinium coordination compound with acyldihydrazone of adipic acid and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one,The structure of a gadolinium coordination compound with acyldihydrazone of adipic acid and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one is studied by the XRD. It is determined that the compound is built as a spacer-armed dinuclear complex in which coordination polyhedra are linked by three aliphatic bridges packed in the asymmetric triple helix. The coordination polyhedron of the gadolinium cation has a slightly distorted three-capped trigonal prism geometry.
Nickel(II) complexes with cytosine and threonine: Synthesis and structure,"Mono-and mixed-ligand complexes with the composition [Ni(Cyt)2(H2O)2]Cl2, [Ni(Thr–)2(H2O)2] and [Ni(Thr–)(Cyt)(H2O)2]Cl are synthesized and studied. Using IR spectroscopy it is determined that in the complex compounds, cytosine is bidentate (C=O group oxygen and heterocycle N3), threonine interacts with the Ni(II) ion due to amino and carboxyl groups. The models of the atomic structure of the studied compounds are proposed based on the EXAFS and XANES spectroscopy results."
Comparative characteristics of a tryptophan molecule in the gas phase and water,The L and D isomers of the tryptophan (Trp) molecule and the (Trp)+ cation in the gas phase and water are calculated at the DFT level to reveal the effect of water considered in the dielectric continuum approximation on the electronic characteristics of the molecule. The distribution of effective atomic charges and bond lengths enables the prediction of the most probable parts of the chemical bond cleavage during the fragmentation of the molecule under the ionizing particle flux. These data are supplemented with a calculation of fragmentation energies. Zwitterionic structures characterized by the appearance of considerable dipole moments and a change in their orientation with respect to the ground state are distinguished among the possible isomeric forms in water.
Composition and structure of hydrates of CH3COOH molecules and CH3CO2− anions in aqueous solutions,"The optimal configurations, energy parameters, and normal vibrational frequencies of hydrates of the acetic acid molecule and anion (CH3COOH·(H2O)
n
 (n = 1-10) and CH3CO2−⋅(H2O)
n
 (n = 1-8, 16)) are calculated by density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p)). The comparison of the calculation results with the known experimental data (Raman, NMR, and so on) gives arguments in favor of the existence of two stable heteroassociates (HAs) in СН3СООН–H2O solutions: previously found CH3COOH·(H2O)2 heterotrimer and CH3COOH·(H2O)8, and three complexes (CH3CO2−⋅(H2O)2, CH3CO2−⋅(H2O)6, and CH3CO2−⋅(H2O)16) in NaCH3CO2−–H2O solutions. Each of them is most stable in a series of isomers, contains unstrained H bonds, and is characterized by the maximum molecular packing density among HAs with similar n values. The structure of the subsequent complex formed in solution uniquely follows the structure of the preceding complex and is based on it."
"Molecular structures, hirshfeld surface analysis, and spectroscopic properties of 6,8-dimethyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrimido[4,5-c]pyridazin-5(6H)-one and 6,8-dimethyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-thioxo-7,8-dihydropyrimido[4,5-c]pyridazin-5(6H)-one","X-ray crystallography images are used to perform DFT studies of the structural, electronic, intermolecular energies and IR frequencies of 6,8-dimethyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrimido[4,5-c]pyridazin-5(6H)-one (A) and 6,8-dimethyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-thioxo-7,8-dihydropyrimido[4,5-c]pyridazin-5(6H)-one (B) using Gaussian 98 and Crystal Explorer program packages. The optimization of A and B in vacuum and solvent (ethanol) phases represent negligible changes in the bond distances, bond angles, and torsion angles. Moreover, the optimization in ethanol is closer to the X-ray crystallography data as compared to the gas phase. Moreover, the Hirshfеld surface analysis reveals that the highest amount of close contact contributions relates to H—H contacts while the lowest amount goes to Cl—Cl/Cl—Cl and C—O/O—C close contacts for A and B, respectively. The corresponding calculated IR intensity values highly match the experimental data."
Crystal structure of Na10[{Na(H2O)H2Nb6O19}2(μ-H2O)2]·46H2O,The diffusion of acetone vapor into a Na7H[Nb6O19] solution at pH 9.5 results in the crystallization of the Na10[{Na(H2O)H2Nb6O19}2(μ-H2O)2]·46H2O (1) complex characterized by X-ray diffraction. The sodium cation coordination to a triangular face of the anion enables the determination of anion protonation sites by blocking the disordering and the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the anions.
Dyeing performance of the azo dyes containing trifluoromethyl group for polyester fabrics and its single crystal structure,"The structures of disperse dyes and their intermolecular interactions have important impacts on dyeing and printing performances for polyester fabrics. The fluorine dyes show some unique molecular stability and photochemical properties. The dyeing property of the azo dye containing trifluoromethyl group for polyester fabrics, 4'-(N-acetoxyethyl-Nethyl)- amino-2-bromine-4-nitro-6-trifluoromethylazo- benzene (D1), was investigated and compared with the similar structure disperse dye. The results show that the high color yield and good exhaustion of the dyed PET fabrics could be obtained. The polyester fabrics dyed with D1 had excellent light fastness. Its single crystal was prepared and the supramolecular interactions were solved by X-ray diffraction. Dye D1 formed triclinic crystals in a trimeric packing mode. The C-F bond distances of CF3 are 1.2730 Å, 1.2240 Å and 1.2900 Å, respectively. The two benzene rings linked azo unit (-N=N-) are obviously twist. The dihedral angle of the two benzene rings is 50.23 o. There are six weak hydrogen bonds around trifluoromethyl group in the intramolecule and intermolecule. The excellent light stability of the dye should be attributed to its unique supramolecular structure."
Light transmission and the fine structure of poly(methyl methacrylate) nanofibers and films,"In this paper, the structure and optical properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanofibers and films were investigated. Differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and Wide-Angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) results confirmed the amorphous structure of both nanofibers and films. Low angle X-ray diffraction (LA-XRD) revealed the presence of voids and/or particles with the spacing of 128.4 Å within the nanofibers. From the Porod plots, a three-dimensional surface fractal for the nanofibers and a mass fractal structure for the films were derived. By the interpretation of Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), the shape and size of the particles in the samples were assessed. It was concluded that the particles shape within the nanofibers and the films were globular, with the radius of gyration of 8.5 nm for the nanofibers and 16.5 nm for the films. The nanofiber mat showed less light transparency when compared with the film. This phenomenon could be attributed to the difference in the physical shape, as well as scattering of the light by the voids or particles within the nanofibers."
Electrospun curcumin loaded poly(lactic acid) nanofiber mat on the flexible crosslinked PVA/PEG membrane film: Characterization and in vitro release kinetic study,"Herein, a biodegradable and biocompatible composite comprising of support membrane based on crosslinked PVA/PEG film and curcumin loaded electrospun poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanofiber mat is introduced. The membrane film was prepared from PVA/PEG blend followed by crosslinking with an optimum amount of citric acid, 15 wt.%. After then, PLA solutions with different curcumin content, 0-11 wt.%, were electrospinned on the prepared membrane substrate. The prepared film showed high water absorption, water vapor transmission rate and superior mechanical properties with improved elastic modulus, tensile strength and with an elongation of around 320 % with respect to the non-crosslinked one. Also, the scanning electron microscopy was revealed uniformly dispersed pores throughout the membrane film with a nearly narrow in size distribution centered at 36 μm. As well, a nanostructure porous morphology was found for the electrospun fibrous curcumin loaded PLA from the scanning electron microscopy micrographs and the average fiber diameter was decreased with curcumin content. In vitro drug release from the prepared flexible composite into the vertical diffusion cell was recorded by the measuring curcuminoids content using high performance liquid chromatography and drug release kinetic evaluations were revealed that the release pattern of all prepared samples, containing different content of curcumin, well fitted to the Higuchi’s model signifying diffusion-controlled release mechanism. As well, the determined release rate at the second release stages, i.e. steady state flux (J), was varied from 0.31 to 43.53 μg·cm-2·h-1 with increasing drug content from 1 to 11 wt.%. Regarding this results, this flexible composite by providing the moist environment along with miraculous healing properties of curcumin, can be potential candidate for transdermal drug delivery."
Effect of chelating agent in disperse dye dyeing on polyester fabric,"In this study, mild acid based chelating agents (glycolic acid, gluconic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and citric acid) were used for the dyeing of polyester fabrics with metal sensitive disperse dye in closed dyeing process. The chelating and pH adjustment efficiencies were compared in disperse dyeing condition. In the comparative analysis with different chelating agents, glycolic acid showed a higher chelation efficiency and consequently showed higher dye bath exhaustion and color strength. Slight differences in the color fastness of the dyed samples obtained by employing four different chelating agents were observed."
Fabrication of hydrophobic/oleophilic cotton fabric by mussel-inspired chemistry for oil/water separation,"A straightforward approach was proposed to modify cotton fabric for oil/water separation based on musselinspired reaction. The poly(DMA-Octadecyl acrylate) was designed to contain key chemical constituents present in mussel adhesive proteins by free radical polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride and octadecyl acrylate, which strongly adsorbed to fabric substrates, providing a special surface for fabric. The chemical structure, surface topography, and surface wettability of the fabric were characterized. The results showed that as-prepared cotton fabric displayed a high CA of >150° when dripped water droplets were on the modified fabric surface, and the oil contact angle (OCA) was close to 0°, it had excellent potential to be used in practical applications and has created a new method of fabric modification for oil/water separation."
Viscoelastic modelling of creep and stress relaxation behaviour in PLA-PCL fibres,"In case of high performance athletes, ligaments are the most commonly injured tissues. Current gold standard process for replacement of ligament is autografting. Research in the field of biodegradable polymers (as a possible ligament device) has helped in overcoming the various drawbacks of autografting. Biodegradable blend of polylactic acid and polycaprolactone (PLA-PCL) have been proposed for use in a medical device to repair injured ligaments. By using a mathematical model, this study aims to characterise the non-linear viscoelastic properties of PLA-PCL fibres. In the present study, two modified models were used; the Burger’s model and three-element standard solid model. The model parameters were calibrated by using the tensile and creep experimental data. In case of Burger’s model, the parameters were significantly affected by the stress level. This functional stress dependency was represented by a second degree polynomial. By employing the previously computed parameters, the stress relaxation data of PLA-PCL fibres was used to check the model simulations. Only the predictions generated from the modified three-element standard solid model were found to be in an agreement with the experimental data. This model enables representing the general viscoelastic response of PLA-PCL fibres through a unique set of parameters."
The limits of non-standard contingency,"Gideon Rosen has recently sketched an argument which aims to establish that the notion of metaphysical modality is systematically ambiguous. His argument contains a crucial sub-argument which has been used to argue for Metaphysical Contingentism, the view that some claims of fundamental metaphysics are metaphysically contingent rather than necessary. In this paper, Rosen’s argument is explicated in detail and it is argued that the most straight-forward reconstruction fails to support its intended conclusion. Two possible ways to save the argument are rebutted and it is furthermore argued that the crucial sub-argument only supports a rather particular variant of Metaphysical Contingentism."
A block based watermarking approach for color images using discrete wavelet transformation,A new block based blind color image watermarking method is presented in this work. The proposed method has been implemented using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The host color image is initially subjected to DWT and the coefficients belonging to a particular frequency band so obtained are divided into different blocks for watermark embedding. The watermark comprising of a grayscale image is bit sliced and the resultant bits are inserted in the image blocks in a predetermined fashion. Only a portion of each image blocks is considered for watermarking embedding and the remaining parts are used as a guard band with the adjacent blocks. The experimental results have shown that the impact of attacks has reduced to a large extend by employing the above mentioned procedure which in turn has significantly improved the security and robustness of the proposed watermarking scheme.
"Prioritizing the Drivers of Green Supply Chain Management in Indian Manufacturing Industries Using Fuzzy TOPSIS Method: Government, Industry, Environment, and Public Perspectives","Environmental sustainability has become a major concern in the present era. The pressure of sustainable development is not only exerted by the government but also by the customer. Awareness among the society and strict government regulations force the industries to reduce environmental impact from their supply chain. Hence, green supply chain management (GSCM) has become an imperative industrial philosophy to avoid environmental hazards. There are motivational forces which are responsible for the implementation of GSCM practices. These motivational forces are termed as drivers. The objective of this paper is to prioritize the drivers of GSCM in Indian manufacturing industries based on government, industry, environment, and public perspectives using fuzzy TOPSIS methodology. An empirical study is made by collecting the data from a group of 12 decision-makers (DMs), three from each perspective. Sensitivity analysis is performed to check the effect of preferences given by each DM. The results show that the regulations forced by the central government play the most significant role followed by regional/state government legislation. The results obtained help firms in identifying the important drivers to implement GSCM practices in Indian manufacturing industries based on different perspectives. It will also help the policymakers to identify important drivers of GSCM in Indian manufacturing industries and will support in implementing GSCM practices."
"Isotopic and dietary niches as indicators for resource partitioning in the gleaner bats Myotis bechsteinii, M. nattereri, and Plecotus auritus","The n-dimensional ecological niche summarizes all living requirements of a species. According to the competition and niche theory, co-occurring species have to differ in at least one dimension to live in stable coexistence. Measuring the overall ecological niche within natural ecosystems is probably impossible but methods that describe several dimensions at once like the isotopic niche are good approximations. However, the impact of each factor contributing to the isotopic niche might be difficult to estimate. The dietary niche, as one part of the isotopic niche, can be examined with high resolution using molecular techniques. In this study we aimed to improve our understanding of species coexistence. We outlined the importance of the isotopic and dietary niches in the context of resource partitioning using the bat species Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri, and Plecotus auritus of the gleaner guild as examples. The dietary and isotopic niches were estimated with stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. We tested (i) how distinct the occupied dietary niches of members of the same guild are and (ii) how similar the dietary and isotopic niches are to each other. While the inter-specific overlap was high for the dietary niche, no overlap could be observed for the isotopic niche. In general, the isotopic niche can describe a more complete picture of the ecological niche, while the dietary niche provides highly detailed information. The combination of both niches might advance our understanding of stable species coexistences."
Markov based transition probability geostatistics in groundwater applications: assumptions and limitations,"Markov based transition probability geostatistics (MTPG) for categorical variables, as implemented by the methodological framework introduced by Carle and Fogg (Math Geol 29(7):891–918, 1997) and extended thereafter, have been extensively applied for the three-dimensional (3D) statistical representation of hydrofacies in real-world aquifers, and the conditional simulation of 3D lithologies for groundwater flow and transport simulations. While conceptually simple and easy to implement, conditional simulation using the MTPG approach is not limitation free. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that raises such concerns in the light of theoretical arguments and numerical findings. That said, the purpose of this study is twofold: (1) present a brief and coherent overview of the basic theory, fundamental assumptions, and limitations of the MTPG methodological framework, and (2) assess its capabilities on the basis of a simple two-dimensional test-case, using large ensembles of stochastic realizations. Contrary to real-world 3D aquifers, where the actual geology is unknown, and the quality of the simulations can be assessed solely on the basis of semi-quantitative arguments using properly selected sets of stochastic realizations, test-cases allow for direct quantitative assessments based on the application of statistical measures to large ensembles of synthetic realizations. Our analysis and obtained results show that stochastic modeling of actual geologies using the MTPG approach of Carle and Fogg (1997), is characterized by simplifying assumptions and theoretical limitations, with the simulated random fields exhibiting statistical structures that strongly depend on the problem under consideration and the modeling assumptions made, leading to increased epistemic uncertainties in the obtained results."
Casimir Effect and Black Hole Radiation,"The gravitational field of a black hole intrinsically creates a potential barrier consisted of two reflecting boundaries; the first one far from the hole and the second one in the vicinity of its horizon. With respect to this fact and assuming the boundaries as good conductors (in view of an observer near the horizon just outside the second boundary), in a series of papers, R.M. Nugayev by considering a conformally coupled massless scalar field and based on the calculations of Candelas and Deutsch (the accelerated-mirror results) has claimed that “...the existence of the potential barrier is as crucial for Hawking evaporation as the existence of the horizon”. In this paper, by taking the same assumptions, through straightforward reasonings, we explicitly show that contrary to this claim, the effects of the first boundary on the black hole radiation are quite negligible. Moreover, the inclusion of the second boundary makes the situation more complicated, because the induced Casimir energy-momentum tensor by this boundary in its vicinity is divergent of order \(\delta ^{-4}\) (δ is the distance to the boundary)."
Estimates of the Modeling Error of the \(\alpha \)-Models of Turbulence in Two and Three Space Dimensions,"This report investigates the convergence rate of the weak solutions \(\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }\) of the Leray-\(\alpha \), modified Leray-\(\alpha \), Navier–Stokes-\(\alpha \) and the zeroth ADM turbulence models to a weak solution \(\mathbf{u}\) of the Navier–Stokes equations. It is assumed that this weak solution \(\mathbf{u}\) of the NSE belongs to the space \(L^4(0, T; H^1)\). It is shown that under this regularity condition the error \(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }\) is \(\mathcal {O}(\alpha )\) in the norms \(L^2(0, T; H^1)\) and \(L^{\infty }(0, T; L^2)\), thus improving related known results. It is also shown that the averaged error \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}-\overline{\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }}\) is higher order, \(\mathcal {O}(\alpha ^{1.5})\), in the same norms, therefore the \(\alpha \)-regularizations considered herein approximate better filtered flow structures than the exact (unfiltered) flow velocities."
Damping of thickly coated fibrous composites with viscous interfaces under longitudinal shear,"We study the damping of thickly coated fibrous composites with viscous fiber-coating and coating-matrix interfaces under longitudinal shear loads. The specific damping capacity is derived by means of the three-phase composite cylinder model. Our analysis indicates that the specific damping capacity depends on six dimensionless parameters: the fiber and coating volume fractions, two stiffness ratios, and two interface parameters arising from rate-dependent interface sliding."
On the yield strength of a ductile material reinforced with rigid spherical inclusions,"A micromechanics model for predicting the mechanical properties of a particulate composite is developed. The reinforcing particles are assumed to be rigid and spherical in shape, while the matrix is elastic–perfectly plastic. The interactions among the inclusions are taken into consideration by Mori–Tanaka’s approach. The elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio and yield strength of the composite can be conveniently predicted and systematically investigated. The predictions of the model are discussed and compared with other theories. It is concluded that the yield strength of the composite can be improved by increasing the volume fraction of inclusions for most of loading conditions but not for certain loading paths such as spherical (hydrostatic) stress loading. The open-ended circular cylinder of v. Mises yield surface about the spherical stress axis in the principal stress space for the pure matrix changes to a more complicate yield surface ending at two apexes in the spherical stress axis for the composite."
An Onsager Singularity Theorem for Turbulent Solutions of Compressible Euler Equations,"We prove that bounded weak solutions of the compressible Euler equations will conserve thermodynamic entropy unless the solution fields have sufficiently low space-time Besov regularity. A quantity measuring kinetic energy cascade will also vanish for such Euler solutions, unless the same singularity conditions are satisfied. It is shown furthermore that strong limits of solutions of compressible Navier–Stokes equations that are bounded and exhibit anomalous dissipation are weak Euler solutions. These inviscid limit solutions have non-negative anomalous entropy production and kinetic energy dissipation, with both vanishing when solutions are above the critical degree of Besov regularity. Stationary, planar shocks in Euclidean space with an ideal-gas equation of state provide simple examples that satisfy the conditions of our theorems and which demonstrate sharpness of our L3-based conditions. These conditions involve space-time Besov regularity, but we show that they are satisfied by Euler solutions that possess similar space regularity uniformly in time."
Anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of Calendula officinalis on inflammatory bone loss in rats,The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of Calendula officinalis (CLO) on alveolar bone loss (ABL) in rats.
The Manchester-Fothergill procedure versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension: a matched historical cohort study,This study compares vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension (VH) with the Manchester-Fothergill procedure (MP) for treating pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in the apical compartment.
Ascorbic acid: still controversial when used against cancer resistance?,"Ascorbic acid is known to be a strong antioxidant that exerts pro-oxidative effects at high concentrations and/or dosages. Therefore, it can be used as a protective agent and as an adjuvant or direct cytotoxic agent. Cancer cell resistance is a well-known issue, which encourages scientists to search for ways to fight it. The use of ascorbic acid against cancer resistance remains controversial. This paper outlines the potential use of ascorbic acid in cancer resistance, especially resistance due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although it is hoped that this vitamin is useful in this setting, more research is needed."
Isolation and characterization from solar salterns of North Algeria of a haloarchaeon producing a new halocin,"Halophilic archaea, thriving in hypersaline environments, synthesize antimicrobial substances with an unknown role, called halocins. It has been suggested that halocin production gives transient competitive advantages to the producer strains and represents one of the environmental factors influencing the microbial community composition. Herein, we report on the antibacterial activity of a new haloarchaeon selected from solar salterns of the northern coast of Algeria. A total of 81 halophilic strains, isolated from the microbial consortia, were screened for the production of antimicrobial compounds by interspecies competition test and against a collection of commercial haloarchaea. On the basis of the partial 16S rRNA sequencing, the most efficient halocin producer was recognized as belonging to Haloferax (Hfx) sp., while the best indicator microorganism, showing high sensitivity toward halocin, was related to Haloarcula genus. The main morphological, physiological and biochemical properties of Hfx were investigated and a partial purification of the produced halocin was allowed to identify it as a surface membrane protein with a molecular mass between 30 and 40 kDa. Therefore, in this study, we isolated a new strain belonging to Haloferax genus and producing a promising antimicrobial compound useful for applications in health and food industries."
Population cost-effectiveness of the Triple P parenting programme for the treatment of conduct disorder: an economic modelling study,"Parenting programmes are the recommended treatments of conduct disorders (CD) in children, but little is known about their longer term cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the population cost-effectiveness of one of the most researched evidence-based parenting programmes, the Triple P—Positive Parenting Programme, delivered in a group and individual format, for the treatment of CD in children. A population-based multiple cohort decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted of Triple P compared with a ‘no intervention’ scenario, using a health sector perspective. The model targeted a cohort of 5–9-year-old children with CD in Australia currently seeking treatment, and followed them until they reached adulthood (i.e., 18 years). Multivariate probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to incorporate uncertainty in the model parameters. Triple P was cost-effective compared to no intervention at a threshold of AU$50,000 per DALY averted when delivered in a group format [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) = $1013 per DALY averted; 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 471–1956] and in an individual format (ICER = $20,498 per DALY averted; 95% UI 11,146–39,470). Evidence-based parenting programmes, such as the Triple P, for the treatment of CD among children appear to represent good value for money, when delivered in a group or an individual face-to-face format, with the group format being the most cost-effective option. The current model can be used for economic evaluations of other interventions targeting CD and in other settings."
Outcomes of the Bryan cervical disc replacement: fifteen year follow-up,The CTDR is a technique that treats cervical disc degenerative disease. Initial shorter-term studies showed good clinical and radiological results.
A New radiographic feature of lower lumbar disc herniation in young patients,"In our study, we assessed the condition of the lumbar laminae defect of L5, other than the defect of spina bifida, in a group of different ages with lower lumbar disc herniation (LDH). We hypothesize that the laminae defect of L5 may be a radiographic feature in young patients with lower LDH."
Discrete version of Wiener-Khinchin theorem for Chebyshev’s spectrum of electrochemical noise,"A discrete version of Wiener-Khinchin theorem for Chebyshev’s spectrum of electrochemical noise is developed. Based on the discrete version of Wiener-Khinchin theorem, the theoretical discrete Chebyshev spectrum for the Markov random process is calculated. It is characterized by two parameters: the dispersion and the relaxation frequency (or relaxation time). The noise of corrosion process and the noise of recording equipment are measured. Using the theoretical Chebyshev spectrum, the Markov parameters were found both for the noise of the corrosion process and for the noise of the measuring equipment."
Solvent effect on the degree of (a)synchronicity in polar Diels-Alder reactions from the perspective of the reaction force constant analysis,"In this work, we computationally evaluated the influence of six different molecular solvents, described as a polarizable continuum model at the M06-2X/6–31+G(d,p) level, on the activation barrier/reaction rate, overall energy change, TS geometry, and degree of (a)synchronicity of two concerted Diels-Alder cycloadditions of acrolein (R1) and its complex with Lewis acid acrolein···BH3 (R2) to cyclopentadiene. In gas-phase, we found that both exothermicity and activation barrier are only reduced by about 2.0 kcal mol−1, and the asynchronicity character of the mechanism is accentuated when BH3 is included. An increment in the solvent’s polarity lowers the activation energy of R1 by 1.3 kcal mol−1, while for R2 the reaction rate is enhanced by more than 2000 times at room temperature (i.e., the activation energy decreases by 4.5 kcal mol−1) if the highest polar media is employed. Therefore, a synergistic effect is achieved when both external agents, i.e., Lewis acid catalyst and polar solvent, are included together. This effect was ascribed to the ability of the solvent to favor the encounter between cyclopentadiene and acrolein···BH3. This was validated by the asymmetry of the TS which becomes highly pronounced when either both or just BH3 is considered or the solvent’s polarity is increased. Finally, the reaction force constant κ(ξ) reveals that an increment in the solvent’s polarity is able to turn a moderate asynchronous mechanism of the formation of the new C-C σ-bonds into a highly asynchronous one."
"Microalgae-mediated brewery wastewater treatment: effect of dilution rate on nutrient removal rates, biomass biochemical composition, and cell physiology","Microalgae have been used to remove nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from brewery wastewater (BWW). The microalga Scenedesmus obliquus was grown on BWW, using bubble column photobioreactors that operated under batch and continuous regimes. For the first time, the cell physiological status cell membrane integrity and enzymatic activity was monitored during the microalgae based BWW treatment, using flow cytometry. All the cultivations batch and continuous displayed a proportion of cells with intact membrane > 87%, although the continuous cultivations displayed a lower proportion of cells with enzymatic activity (20–40%) than the batch cultivations (97%). The dilution rate of 0.26 day−1 was the most favorable condition, since the microalgae cultivation attained the maximum biomass productivity (0.2 g ash-free dry weight day−1) and the total nitrogen and COD removal rates were the highest (97 and 74%, respectively), while the phosphorous removal rate was the third (23%)."
Evaluation of the mixing performance in a planar passive micromixer with circular and square mixing chambers,"In this paper, passive planar micromixers based on circular and square mixing chambers spaced at equidistant along the length of micromixer are proposed to operate in the laminar flow regime for high mixing index. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed micromixers by solving the Navier–Stokes equation and convection–diffusion equation. A COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0 is used for computational fluid dynamics. Numerical simulation of mixing of fluids in a micromixer with circular and square chambers in a laminar flow regime has been carried out. Four performance parameters namely, mixing index, pressure drop, pumping power, and performance index are used to evaluate different design configurations of micromixers. Analysis of mixing index based on the standard deviation of the mass fraction is carried with different constriction channel width such as 200, 250, and 300 µm for a range of Reynolds number from 0.1 to 75. The both micromixers show over 95% mixing at the exit for the range 15–75 of Reynolds number at constriction width of 200 µm. Especially, about 99% mixing is achieved at Reynolds number less than one i.e. at 0.1. The effect of Reynolds number on the pressure drop is also investigated. Thus, the proposed micromixers can be used in microfluidic systems which require fast mixing at Re less than 1 and greater than 15."
Electro-thermal analysis of an Al–Ti multilayer thin film microheater for MEMS thruster application,A multilayer thin film aluminum/titanium (Al/Ti) microheater is developed for the microthruster liquid propellant vaporizing and gas heating for increasing the specific impulse. The microheater was fabricated onto a Pyrex 7740 substrate using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems processing technology. A finite-element based multiphysics simulation was employed to simulate the microheater performance. The distribution of temperature and variation of the thermal deformation are simulated in modeling with the different input power. And the simulation shows that heat loss of the microheater is relatively low comparing with the normal heater. Subsequently an experimental testing of the microheater performance based on infrared imaging device was actualized with applied voltage from 5 to 36 V. An auger electron spectroscopy detection was employed to validating the assumption that Al layer oxidizing is the main reason of temperature higher in the test than simulation.
Profiling the onset of somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis,"Totipotency is the ability of a cell to regenerate a whole organism. Plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a remarkable example of totipotency because somatic cells reverse differentiation, respond to an appropriate stimulus and initiate embryo development. Although SE is an ideal system to investigate de-differentiation and differentiation, we still lack a deep molecular understanding of the phenomenon due to experimental restraints."
Cold-responsive miRNAs and their target genes in the wild eggplant species Solanum aculeatissimum,"Low temperature is an important abiotic stress in plant growth and development, especially for thermophilic plants. Eggplants are thermophilic vegetables, although the molecular mechanism of their response to cold stress remains to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play an essential role during plant development and stress responses. Although the role of many plant miRNAs in facilitating chilling tolerance has been verified, little is known about the mechanisms of eggplant chilling tolerance."
Transcriptome analysis reveals key roles of AtLBR-2 in LPS-induced defense responses in plants,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria cause innate immune responses in animals and plants. The molecules involved in LPS signaling in animals are well studied, whereas those in plants are not yet as well documented. Recently, we identified Arabidopsis AtLBR-2, which binds to LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pLPS) directly and regulates pLPS-induced defense responses, such as pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1) expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we investigated the pLPS-induced transcriptomic changes in wild-type (WT) and the atlbr-2 mutant Arabidopsis plants using RNA-Seq technology."
Highly accurate sequence imputation enables precise QTL mapping in Brown Swiss cattle,"Within the last few years a large amount of genomic information has become available in cattle. Densities of genomic information vary from a few thousand variants up to whole genome sequence information. In order to combine genomic information from different sources and infer genotypes for a common set of variants, genotype imputation is required."
Fertilizer recommendations for maize production in the South Sudan and Sudano-Guinean zones of Benin,"The present study aims to determine fertilizer (N–P–K) recommendations for maize (Zea mays L.) on Acrisols (south Benin) and Ferric and Plintic Luvisols (centre Benin). Two years (2011 and 2012) experiment was conducted at Dogbo and Allada districts (southern) and Dassa (centre Benin). Six on-farm experiments were carried out to validate fertilizer rates simulated by the DSSAT model. The experimental design in each field was a completely randomized bloc with four replications and ten N–P–K rates: 0–0–0 (control), 44–15–17.5 (standard fertilizer recommendation for maize), 80–30–40, 80–15–40, 80–30–25, 80–30–0, 69–30–40, 92–30–40, 69–15–25 and 46–15–25 kg ha−1. Treatments 44–15–17.5 and 46–15–25 showed the lowest grain and stover yields. The observed maize grain yields were highly correlated with the estimated grain yields (R2 values varied between 80 and 91% for growing season 2011 and between 68 and 94% for growing season of 2012). The NRSME values varied between 12.54 and 22.56% (for growing season of 2011) and between 13.09 and 24.13% (for growing season of 2012). The economic analysis for the past 32 years (1980–2012) including the current experiment showed that N–P–K rates 80–30–25 (at Dogbo), 80–15–40 (at Allada) and 80–30–0 (at Dassa) were the best fertilizer recommendations as they presented the highest grain yields and the best return to investment per hectare. Nevertheless, 80–30–25 is advised for Dassa considering that sustainable maize production will require regular inputs of potassium. The 2 years of field experiments were not sufficient to derive biophysically optimal fertilizer recommendation rates for each site."
Enhanced Terahertz Absorption of Graphene Composite Integrated with Double Circular Metal Ring Array,"Graphene-based terahertz (THz) devices, such as modulators, detectors, and absorbers, play important roles in terahertz applications due to graphene’s effectively tunable terahertz absorption. The features of these terahertz devices are greatly related to the THz absorption of graphene. However, the monolayer graphene shows limited absorption to terahertz waves. In this paper, we demonstrated a new graphene composite with a double circular metal ring array deposited on graphene to enhance the absorption. The graphene composite consists of a double circular metal ring array, a monolayer graphene, silicon dioxide, and silicon substrates. The double circular metal ring array locally enhances the electromagnetic field on graphene and further increases graphene’s absorption. It shows that the peak absorption of the proposed graphene composite is increased to 95% for graphene Fermi level 0 eV at room temperature, which is more than seven times larger than that of the graphene composite without the double circular metal ring array. The enhanced terahertz absorption of the proposed graphene composite shows the potential ability of improving modulation depth and insertion loss of a THz reflection modulator."
Cytotoxicity of propofol in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes,"Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is a lethal condition caused by propofol overdose. Previous studies suggest that pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PRIS involve mitochondrial dysfunction; however, these mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to establish an experimental model of propofol-induced cytotoxicity using cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to determine the mechanisms behind propofol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and to evaluate the protective effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)."
Effect of Curcumin and Gliotoxin on Rat Liver Myofibroblast Culture,"Since the 1990s, when it was demonstrated by Hammel and others that liver fibrosis is reversible, researchers and physicians actively search for new antifibrotic therapies. In recent years, knowledge of liver fibrosis pathophysiology has greatly advanced and new cellular and molecular mechanisms were described. The cells that determine extracellular matrix components distribution are myofibroblasts, but their origin is diverse. They can be activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), portal fibroblasts (PF), or circulating mesenchymal stem cells of the bone marrow. Among large number of substrates to inhibit activation, to inhibit proliferation of myofibroblasts, and to induce their apoptosis we, chose curcumin and gliotoxin. Primarily, in the current work, we optimized the explantation culture method for isolation of hepatic myofibroblasts and received two different cultures—myofibroblasts of HSC and PF origin. Exposition of 50 μM curcumin and 0.1 μM gliotoxin was the most optimal; we observed suppression of hepatic myofibroblast activation and inhibition of their proliferation. These results extend the current knowledge of the cells within the liver fibrogenic populations and prove inhibitory influence of biologically active substances (curcumin and gliotoxin) on portal myofibroblasts."
Non-stationary Channel Estimation with Diffusion Adaptation Strategies Over Distributed Networks,In this paper we address non-stationary channel estimation problem with diffusion least mean square algorithm in distributed adaptive wireless sensor networks. Here we estimate channel coefficients or taps that are produced with Rayleigh fading models. All detailed explanations regarding to this fading channel type are presented and it is explained that how we can extend channel estimation with sensor networks to other newly presented channel types. We use the tracking performance analysis of diffusion cooperation over adaptive sensor networks to investigate the reliability of used algorithms and show the link between channel estimation problem and tracking a time varying entity. Theoretical analyzes are performed and the results are compared with simulation performance diagrams. It is proven that there is a reasonable match between these two outcomes. We present our results with the mean square deviation criteria.
Proactive Eavesdropping via Pilot Contamination and Jamming,"Proactive eavesdropping is a new paradigm shift in wireless physical layer security from preventing conventional eavesdropping attacks to legitimate intercepting suspicious communications, which has attracted a lot of attention recently. Pilot contamination is one effective technique in proactive eavesdropping, which spoofs the suspicious transmitter on channel estimation by sending the same pilot signal as the suspicious receiver, and lets it leak information in the direction of the legitimate eavesdropper during its transmission. However, this technique may fail when an anti-pilot-contamination mechanism called “energy ratio detector (ERD)” is applied at the suspicious receiver. To deal with the case that the suspicious receiver is a smart device using ERD, in this paper, we study using pilot contamination along with jamming to improve the legitimate eavesdropping performance. We first derive a closed-form expression for the probability of pilot contamination being detected by the suspicious receiver, and use it to obtain a closed-form expression for the eavesdropping rate. Using this theoretical analysis result, we propose an algorithm to maximize the eavesdropping rate by jointly optimizing the pilot contamination power and jamming power via two-dimensional search. Simulation results show that the proposed eavesdropping rate maximization algorithm can significantly improve eavesdropping rate, as compared to other benchmark schemes."
Solubilization of phosphorus from phosphate rocks with Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans following a growing-then-recovery process,"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the synthesis of biomolecules and is particularly important in agriculture, as soils must be constantly supplemented with its inorganic form to ensure high yields and productivity. In this paper, we propose a process to solubilize phosphorus from phosphate rocks, where Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans cultures are pre-cultivated to foster the acidic conditions for bioleaching-two-step “growing-then-recovery”-. Our method solubilizes 100% of phosphorus, whereas the traditional process without pre-cultivation—single-step “growing-and-recovery”-results in a maximum of 56% solubilization. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that even at low concentrations of the phosphate rock, 1% w/v, the bacterial culture is unviable and biological activity is not observed during the single-step process. On the other hand, in our method, the bacteria are grown without the rock, ensuring high acid production. Once pH levels are below 0.7, the mineral is added to the culture, resulting in high yields of biological solubilization. According to the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectrums, gypsum is the dominant phosphate phase after both the single- and two-step methods. However, calcite and fluorapatite, dominant in the un-treated rock, are still present after the single-step, highlighting the differences between the chemical and the biological methods. Our process opens new avenues for biotechnologies to recover phosphorus in tropical soils and in low-grade phosphate rock reservoirs."
Early generation genetic variation and heritability of yield and related traits among tef populations,"The extent of genetic variation and heritability of a trait are among the major determinants of selection gains in plant breeding programs. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of genetic variation and inheritance of grain yield, and component traits of newly developed tef populations under moisture-stressed and non-stressed conditions for drought tolerance breeding. Seventeen crosses along with the parents were evaluated in the F2 generation under moisture-stressed and non-stressed conditions in northern Ethiopia during 2015 and 2016. There were marked genotypic and phenotypic variation among the crosses in the F2 generation for plant height, panicle length, peduncle length, number of productive tillers per plant, main shoot panicle seed weight, biomass yield, and grain yield under both test conditions, important for successful selection and genetic advancement. The families of DZ-Cr-387 x 207832 and DZ-Cr-387 x 222076 were high grain yielders with early maturity under both test conditions."
Allelic composition and associated quality traits of the Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci in selected modern Ethiopian durum wheat varieties,"Gluten protein determines the processing quality of both durum wheat and bread wheat. The glutenin subunits compositions and associated quality traits of 20 Ethiopian durum wheat varieties were systematically analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Payne numbers. A total of 16 glutenin patterns were identified. At the Glu-A1 locus, all varieties scored the null allele. The predominant glutenin alleles at the Glu-B1 locus were Glu-B1b (7+8) and Glu-B1e (20). In Glu-3, the most abundant glutenin subunits were Glu-A3a and Glu-B3c. Based on the Payne scores, the varieties Yerer, Ginchi, Candate, and Foka were identified to have allelic composition suitable for pasta making. The cluster analysis using agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) method classified the varieties into four similarity classes. Based on the findings of this experiment, suggestions were made for allelic composition improvement through introgression of superior alleles from known Glu-1 and Glu-3 sources."
Functional diversity of RING E3 ligases of major cereal crops in response to abiotic stresses,"Abiotic stresses significantly reduce the grain yield and productivity of cereal crops, especially rice, and this may affect food security in the future. Different abiotic stress adaptation pathways have been investigated and depicted in plants. Among these, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been studied as a key mechanism to understand the protein regulation pathways that enhance the adaptation and survival of plants under various environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, cold, and toxic metalloid exposure. RING E3 ligases constitute a highly diverse and important enzyme group that acts within the 26S UPS, and it also plays a crucial role as a central regulator of plant physiological and cellular processes. This review aimed to highlight recent findings and discoveries regarding the different stress-induced RING E3 ligase genes of major cereal crops and their functions via ubiquitination pathways under different environmental stress conditions. Such genes regulate different physiological responses including protein stabilization, cell membrane integrity, regulation of stomatal opening, and the maintenance of meristematic cells, and they also regulate reactive oxygen species and heavy metal levels via ubiquitination in plants. Hence, the ubiquitination process is considered a potential target for the development of abiotic stress-tolerant crops, and it might be used as an excellent mechanism for stress-tolerant crop improvement programs."

Rezensionen,
Muscle-specific deletion of Prkaa1 enhances skeletal muscle lipid accumulation in mice fed a high-fat diet,"Excessive intramyocellular triacylglycerols (IMTGs, muscle lipids) are associated with the abnormal energy metabolism and insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial cellular energy sensor, consists of α, β and γ subunits. Researchers have not clearly determined whether Prkaa1 (also known as AMPKα1) affects IMTG accumulation in skeletal muscle. Here, we show an important role of Prkaa1 in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. Deletion of muscle Prkaa1 leads to the delayed development of skeletal muscles but does not affect glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity in animals fed a normal diet. Notably, when animals are fed a high-fat diet, the skeletal muscle of muscle-specific Prkaa1 knockout mice accumulates more lipids than the skeletal muscle of wild-type (WT) mice, with concomitant upregulation of adipogenic gene expressions and downregulation of the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial oxidation. Muscle-specific Prkaa1 ablation also results in hyperlipidemia, which may contribute to the increased IMTG levels. Furthermore, Prkaa1 deletion activates skeletal muscle mTOR signalling, which has a central role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidation. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the role of Prkaa1 in skeletal muscle. This knowledge may contribute to the treatment of related metabolic diseases."
"Unmodified Fe3O4 nanostructure promoted with external magnetic field: safe, magnetically recoverable, and efficient nanocatalyst for N- and C-alkylation reactions in green conditions","Transition metal compounds have emerged as suitable catalysts for organic reactions. Magnetic compounds as soft Lewis acids can be used as catalysts for organic reactions. In this report, the Fe3O4 nanostructures were obtained from Fe2+ and Fe3+-salts, under an external magnetic field (EMF) without any protective agent. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy tools were used to characterize these magnetic compounds. The two-dimensional (2-D, it showed nanometric size in the two dimensions, nanorod structure) Fe3O4 compound showed high catalytic activity and stability in N- and C-alkylation reactions. A diverse range of N- and C-alkylation products were obtained in moderate to high yield under green and mild conditions in air. Also the N- and C-alkylation products can be obtained with different selectivity and yield by exposure reactions with EMF. Results of alkylation reactions showed that the presence of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species on the surface of magnetic catalysts (phase structure of magnetic compounds) are essential as very cheap active sites. Also, morphology of magnetic catalysts had influence on their catalytic performances. After the reaction, the catalyst/product(s) separation could be easily achieved with an external magnet and more than 95% of catalyst could be recovered. The catalyst was reused at least four times without any loss of its high catalytic activity for N- and C-alkylation reactions."
"Transition (Mn, Fe) and rare earth (La, Pr) metal doped ceria solid solutions for high performance photocatalysis: Effect of metal doping on catalytic activity","In this work, various transition and rare earth metal ions (M3+; M = Mn3+, Fe3+, La3+, and Pr3+) doped CeO2 solid solutions were prepared by a simple sol–gel method for the degradation of an organic dye, Rhodamine B (RhB) as a model pollutant. The as-prepared samples were thoroughly studied by various characterization techniques to understand the surface and optical properties. The XRD results suggested formation of solid solutions, and TEM studies confirmed the nanosized nature of the ceria particles. The Raman and XPS results revealed that the doping of metal ions enhanced the formation of Ce3+ ions associated with the oxygen vacancies. The doping of M3+ ions in the CeO2 lattice strongly influenced the band gap tuning of undoped CeO2 (3.01 eV) from the UV to Visible region (i.e., 2.45–2.90 eV). Photoluminescence studies suggested that doping of M3+ cations suppresses the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The photocatalytic activity results indicated that the doped CeO2 samples exhibit substantially enhanced photocatalytic performance for the degradation of RhB compared to undoped CeO2. The better catalytic activity of doped CeO2 samples could be attributed to the presence of defects (Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies), which play a prominent role as trapping centres for excited electrons and inhibit the recombination process. The scavengers tests confirmed that the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl (·OH) and super oxide (·O2−) radicals are actively involved in the photodegradation process. This work rendered a new concept for rational design and development of doped CeO2-based materials as better photocatalysts."

Improving Dissolution Rate of Carbamazepine-Glutaric Acid Cocrystal Through Solubilization by Excess Coformer,"The use of soluble cocrystals is a promising strategy for delivering poorly soluble drugs. However, precipitation of poorly soluble crystal form during dissolution hinders the successful tablet development of cocrystals. This work was aimed to understand the mechanisms for improving dissolution performance of a soluble cocrystals by using excess coformer."
The crossover effects of morphological awareness on vocabulary development among children in French immersion,"The purpose of the current study was to explore longitudinally the bidirectional cross-language effects between morphological awareness and vocabulary development across English and French over one year. Participants included 81 Grade 1 students and 75 Grade 2 students. All were non-native speakers of French, and demonstrated average English word reading and vocabulary skills. They received formal instruction entirely in French at school. Children were tested at two time points spaced one year apart with tasks tapping inflectional and derivational morphological awareness, and vocabulary. They also completed measures of phonological awareness, word reading, and non-verbal reasoning. The Grade 1 students were assessed in English only at pretest, and in English and French at post-test. The Grade 2 students were assessed in English and French at both time points. As predicted, regression analyses revealed that English inflectional awareness predicted unique variance in French vocabulary among Grade 1 students. Among Grade 2 students, cross-lagged analyses showed that both English inflectional and English derivational awareness predicted gains in French vocabulary between Grades 2 and 3. Conversely, counter to our expectations, French morphological awareness did not predict gains in English vocabulary over time. Taken together, these results extend the extant corpus of research to substantiate that children can leverage morphological awareness from their primary language to facilitate their vocabulary learning in their second language."
Constant water table sub-irrigation of pots allows derivation of root weights (without physical recovery) and repeated measures of in situ growth and water use efficiencies,"We examined novel ways of non-destructively measuring root weight, plant growth and water use efficiencies to improve the detection of treatment effects in plant phenotyping in pot culture."
A lower bound of concurrence for multipartite quantum systems,"We present a lower bound of concurrence for four-partite systems in terms of the concurrence for \(M\, (2\le M\le 3)\) part quantum systems and give an analytical lower bound for \(2\otimes 2\otimes 2\otimes 2\) mixed quantum sates. It is shown that these lower bounds are able to improve the existing bounds and detect entanglement better. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to multipartite quantum systems."
An Efficient Algorithm for Self-consistent Field Theory Calculations of Complex Self-assembled Structures of Block Copolymer Melts,"Self-consistent field theory (SCFT), as a state-of-the-art technique for studying the self-assembly of block copolymers, is attracting continuous efforts to improve its accuracy and efficiency. Here we present a fourth-order exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta algorithm (ETDRK4) to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE) which is the most time-consuming part of a SCFT calculation. By making a careful comparison with currently most efficient and popular algorithms, we demonstrate that the ETDRK4 algorithm significantly reduces the number of chain contour steps in solving the MDE, resulting in a boost of the overall computation efficiency, while it shares the same spatial accuracy with other algorithms. In addition, to demonstrate the power of our ETDRK4 algorithm, we apply it to compute the phase boundaries of the bicontinuous gyroid phase in the strong segregation regime and to verify the existence of the triple point of the O70 phase, the lamellar phase and the cylindrical phase."
Preoperative medication use and postoperative delirium: a systematic review,Medications are frequently reported as both predisposing factors and inducers of delirium. This review evaluated the available evidence and determined the magnitude of risk of postoperative delirium associated with preoperative medication use.
Prediction of posthepatectomy liver failure using transient elastography in patients with hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma,It is essential to accurately predict Postoperative liver failure (PHLF) which is a life-threatening complication.

The aims of this study were to explore the application of preoperative liver stiffness measurements (LSM) by transient elastography in predicting postoperative liver failure (PHLF) in patients with hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma.
The health and wellbeing needs of veterans: a rapid review,"For the majority of serving members, life in the military has a positive effect on wellbeing. However, the type, intensity and duration of service, along with the transition from fulltime military to civilian life, may have a negative effect on veterans’ wellbeing. Such negative consequences, alongside the growing veteran population, indicate the need for greater exploration of veterans’ physical, mental and social wellbeing."
Economic evaluation of an experience sampling method intervention in depression compared with treatment as usual using data from a randomized controlled trial,"Experience sampling, a method for real-time self-monitoring of affective experiences, holds opportunities for person-tailored treatment. By focussing on dynamic patterns of positive affect, experience sampling method interventions (ESM-I) accommodate strategies to enhance personalized treatment of depression―at potentially low-costs. This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of an experience sampling method intervention in patients with depression, from a societal perspective."
A scoping review of comparisons between abstracts and full reports in primary biomedical research,"Evidence shows that research abstracts are commonly inconsistent with their corresponding full reports, and may mislead readers. In this scoping review, which is part of our series on the state of reporting of primary biomedical research, we summarized the evidence from systematic reviews and surveys, to investigate the current state of inconsistent abstract reporting, and to evaluate factors associated with improved reporting by comparing abstracts and their full reports."
Changes of the perceived quality of care for older patients with hypertension by community health centers in shanghai,Monitoring and evaluating changes of quality of primary care for older adult hypertensive patients is part of effective delivery of primary care. This study aimed to investigate changes of older adult hypertensive patients’ perceived quality of primary care over time in Shanghai.
Clinical drug trials in general practice: how well are external validity issues reported?,"When reading a report of a clinical trial, it should be possible to judge whether the results are relevant for your patients. Issues affecting the external validity or generalizability of a trial should therefore be reported. Our aim was to determine whether articles with published results from a complete cohort of drug trials conducted entirely or partly in general practice reported sufficient information about the trials to consider the external validity."
Effect of impaired twitching motility and biofilm dispersion on performance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-powered microbial fuel cells,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a metabolically voracious bacterium that is easily manipulated genetically. We have previously shown that the organism is also highly electrogenic in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Polarization studies were performed in MFCs with wild-type strain PAO1 and three mutant strains (pilT, bdlA and pilT bdlA). The pilT mutant was hyperpiliated, while the bdlA mutant was suppressed in biofilm dispersion chemotaxis. The double pilT bdlA mutant was expected to have properties of both mutations. Polarization data indicate that the pilT mutant showed 5.0- and 3.2-fold increases in peak power compared to the wild type and the pilT bdlA mutant, respectively. The performance of the bdlA mutant was surprisingly the lowest, while the pilT bdlA electrogenic performance fell between the pilT mutant and wild-type bacteria. Measurements of biofilm thickness and bacterial viability showed equal viability among the different strains. The thickness of the bdlA mutant, however, was twice that of wild-type strain PAO1. This observation implicates the presence of dead or dormant bacteria in the bdlA mutant MFCs, which increases biofilm internal resistance as confirmed by electrochemical measurements."
"Synthetic biology, genome mining, and combinatorial biosynthesis of NRPS-derived antibiotics: a perspective","Combinatorial biosynthesis of novel secondary metabolites derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) has been in slow development for about a quarter of a century. Progress has been hampered by the complexity of the giant multimodular multienzymes. More recently, advances have been made on understanding the chemical and structural biology of these complex megaenzymes, and on learning the design rules for engineering functional hybrid enzymes. In this perspective, I address what has been learned about successful engineering of complex lipopeptides related to daptomycin, and discuss how synthetic biology and microbial genome mining can converge to broaden the scope and enhance the speed and robustness of combinatorial biosynthesis of NRPS-derived natural products for drug discovery."
A pilot exploratory investigation on pregnant women’s views regarding STan fetal monitoring technology,Women’s views are critical for informing the planning and delivery of maternity care services. ST segment analysis (STan) is a promising method to more accurately detect when unborn babies are at risk of brain damage or death during labour that is being trialled for the first time in Australia. This is the first study to examine women’s views about STan monitoring in this context.
An evaluation of a recombinant multiepitope based antigen for detection of Toxoplasma gondii specific antibodies,"The inefficiency of the current tachyzoite antigen-based serological assays for the serodiagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection mandates the need for acquirement of reliable and standard diagnostic reagents. Recently, epitope-based antigens have emerged as an alternative diagnostic marker for the achievement of highly sensitive and specific capture antigens. In this study, the diagnostic utility of a recombinant multiepitope antigen (USM.TOXO1) for the serodiagnosis of human toxoplasmosis was evaluated."
Improved performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay on sputum sediment samples obtained from presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis cases at Kibong’oto infectious diseases hospital in Tanzania,The introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) has significantly improved diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) in resource limited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) endemic settings.

Rapid clinical improvement of amyloid A amyloidosis following treatment with tocilizumab despite persisting amyloid deposition: a case report,"Amyloid A amyloidosis is one of the most common forms of amyloidosis. It is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, which is difficult to manage and has a poor prognosis. We present a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and amyloid A amyloidosis who was treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 receptor, resulting in improvement in both proteinuria and gastrointestinal symptoms; however, amyloid deposition remained."
The impact of intravenous methylprednisolone pulses on renal survival in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis with severe renal injury patients: a retrospective study,High-dose methylprednisolone pulses were one of the main treatments for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides (AAV) but had obvious side effects. We aimed to know the impact on renal survival and identify the prognostic factors of this treatment in Chinese AAV patients with severe renal involvement.
Assessment of CNRM coupled ocean-atmosphere model sensitivity to the representation of aerosols,"Atmospheric aerosols can significantly affect the Earth’s radiative balance due to absorption, scattering and aerosol-cloud interactions. Although our understanding of aerosol properties has improved over recent decades, aerosol radiative forcing remains as one of the largest uncertainties when attributing recent and projecting future anthropogenic climate change. Ensembles of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model were used to investigate how the representation of aerosols within the model can affect climate. The control simulation consisted of a 30-year simulation with an interactive aerosol scheme and aerosol emissions that evolve from 1980–2009. The sensitivity tests included using constant 1980 emissions, using prescribed 2-D monthly mean AODs, modifying the aerosol vertical distribution, altering aerosol optical properties, and changing the parameters used for calculating the aerosol first indirect effect. The results of these sensitivity studies show how modifying certain aspects of the aerosol scheme can significantly affect radiative flux and temperature. In particular, it was shown that compared to the control simulation the use of constant 1980 aerosol emissions decreased the average winter surface temperature of the Arctic by 0.2 K and that the use of prescribed 2-D monthly mean AODs reduced the annual global surface temperature by 0.3 K. Increasing the vertical distribution of anthropogenic aerosols in the model and altering aerosol optical properties modified localised radiative fluxes and temperatures, but the most significant change in global surface temperature (1.3 K) was caused by removing sea salt and organic matter from the calculation of cloud droplet number concentration."
Balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube in adult patients with chronic dilatory tube dysfunction: a retrospective cohort study,The aim of this study is to assess the subjective and objective short-term results and safety of transnasal balloon dilatation of the Eustachian tube (BET) in adult patients with chronic dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD).
"Evaluating New Policy Instruments of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards: Footprint, Credit Transferring, and Credit Trading","The reformed U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have not only tightened the efficiency levels to be achieved by automakers, but also made substantial changes to the regulatory design and structure by introducing three new policy instruments (footprint-based targeting, intra-firm transferring of fuel economy credits across vehicle categories, and inter-firm trading of credits). While there are a number of economics studies on tightening CAFE standards, little attention has been paid to the design aspects. This paper uses policy simulation to evaluate the new policy instruments. First, I model and estimate vehicle purchase and utilization decisions by American households. Based on estimation results, I simulate the effects of four counterfactual CAFE policies with or without the three instruments. Simulation results suggest (1) footprint-based targeting has little impact at the aggregate market level, while at the individual automaker level it favors firms selling relatively large vehicles; (2) allowing intra-firm credit transferring (but not inter-firm credit trading) cuts aggregate gasoline consumption by 0.1–0.3%; and that (3) inter-firm credit trading significantly lowers the aggregate compliance costs (by $110–$140 million), and thus achieves the highest social welfare among the simulated policies."

An optimized virtual beam-based event-oriented algorithm for multiple fault localization in vibrating structures,"This paper investigates a new multiple fault localization method using the virtual beam-based event-oriented algorithm. The virtual beams, represented by some sensor chains, are recently proposed to isolate the potential faults according to the distribution of sensors to certain regions and their associated nonlinear dynamic feature characteristics. To improve the accuracy of fault localization and isolate the multiple faults at more specific and detailed regions, in this paper, the virtual beam-based method is combined with a specially developed feature characterization algorithm named as the subtract on negative add on positive (SNAP). This newly proposed virtual beam-based subtract on negative add on positive (VB-SNAP) method is to take advantage of the virtual beam-based algorithm to narrow the search scope for the potential fault events using fewer sensors and adopt the event estimation strategy of the binary-based SNAP method to enhance the accuracy of fault localization by providing smaller and specific regions containing the potential faults. Two likelihood matrices are constructed according to the alarm states of sensors and the response of sensors from the virtual beams, respectively. Fault localization of the VB-SNAP is, therefore, simplified to estimate the overlapping cells obtained from those two likelihood matrices. The performance of the proposed virtual beam-based event-oriented algorithm is demonstrated through real experimental results. It is shown that the proposed VB-SNAP is superior to the original virtual beam algorithm and SNAP method alone through the localization of multiple bolts loosening in solar panel of a satellite-like structure."
Long-term response to area of competition control in Eucalyptus globulus plantations,"Numerous studies have quantified the responses to vegetation management in Eucalyptus plantations but most publications have reported early responses in tree growth and a gap in knowledge exist about the magnitude and duration of growth responses throughout the whole rotation. We evaluated the long-term response (9 years-old) of E. globulus across a gradient of sites to different intensity levels of free area of competing vegetation around individual tree seedlings. Competing vegetation intensity levels considered free areas ranging between 0 (control) to 2.54 m2 plus a treatment with total weed control. Competing vegetation biomass production during the first growing season was 2.9, 6.5, 2.2 and 12.9 Mg ha−1, for sites ranging from low to high annual rainfall. Across sites, maximum response in stand volume ranged between 58 and 262 m3 ha−1 at age 9 years and was proportional to the amount of competing biomass controlled during the first growing season. Total competing vegetation control showed the largest response in stand volume at sites with 2.9 and 12.9 Mg ha−1 of competing vegetation. However, the 2.54 m2 vegetation control treatment showed the maximum response for sites with 2.2 and 6.5 Mg ha−1 of competing vegetation. The duration of response for vegetation control treatments ranged between 5 and 9 years. However, at the site with the largest accumulation of competing vegetation biomass the response to vegetation control showed a sustained and divergent response. Our results suggest that vegetation control improved site resources acquisition increasing long-term stand productivity by reducing environmental limitations to tree growth differentially at each site."
Religious Commitment and Well-Being in College Students: Examining Conditional Indirect Effects of Meaning in Life,"There is systematic and quantitative evidence that religious commitment is associated with indicators of well-being, such as positive emotions and moods, absence of negative emotions, and satisfaction with life; however, researchers remain far from a consensus regarding which mechanisms may account for these observed relationships. Although religious commitment influences well-being through many different mechanisms, meaning in life is probably the predominant one. Thus, we examined the bidimensional conceptualization of meaning in life as a potential mechanism between religious commitment and well-being. The study was cross-sectional in nature. Survey data were collected from 92 college students, aged 17–21. A battery of self-report measures was used for tapping religious commitment, well-being, and meaning in life. Even though presence of meaning, search for meaning, religious commitment, and well-being correlated moderately with each other, presence of meaning carried a substantial proportion of variance in predicting well-being for girls/women. This study suggests that religious commitment influences a person’s sense of meaning in life, which, in turn, influences her/his well-being. And, we hope that these results encourage professionals to explore with their clients the fundamental questions of meaning and purpose in life."

Structural and ferroelectric properties of microwave heated lead cobalt titanate nanoparticles synthesized by sol–gel technique,The lead cobalt titanate (PCT) nanoparticles were prepared by sol–gel method and further microwave heated at 1023 K for 3/4 h. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the formation of PCT phases. The average crystallite-size was acquired to be 26.3 nm. The surface morphology of specimen was analyzed using transmission electron microscope. The ferroelectric property was elucidated by means of polarization versus electric field loop as a function of temperature.
Effects of Zn-doped on the microstructure and electrical properties of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4(0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) NTC ceramics,"In this paper, the Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) negative temperature coefficient (NTC) ceramics were attained by the traditional solid state reaction method. The effects of Zn addition on microstructure and electrical properties were characterized by thermo-gravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, electrical measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. It was found that the resistivity decreased slightly with increasing Zn ions content for x ≤ 0.2, but increased remarkably for higher Zn ions content. The values ρ25 and B25/50 of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) NTC thermistors were in the range of 126–706 Ω cm and 3323–3714 K, respectively. The values of relative resistance drift (ΔR/R0) were in the range of 2.7–1.13% and had a minimum value with the Zn content x = 0.5 after aging test at 125 °C for 500 h. This suggests that the electrical properties can be adjusted to desired values by controlling the Zn ion doping content. Most importantly, the stability of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 ceramic can be effectively improved by Zn doping."
Observation of magneto-electric coupling in Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 nanoparticles,"Nanoparticles of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 are synthesized using sol–gel method, their structural, electrical and magnetic properties are systematically investigated. The XRD pattern of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 confirms the orthorhombic perovskite structure with an average crystallite size of 14 nm. The thermal study of as prepared powder indicates that Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 crystallizes at about 1073 K. The electrical study reports an enhanced value of room temperature electrical conductivity equal to 9.15 × 10−3 S cm−1. The change in the magnetic moment for Sr doping and paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition is appreciated in magnetic study. The ferromagnetism is accounted for by the Zener’s double exchange interaction between the Co3+ and Co4+. The occurrence of magneto-electric coupling at T ~ 213 K in the study of nanoparticles of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 is the first experimental finding for this sample. The Sr substituted SmCoO3 becomes ferromagnetic with the values of magnetic anisotropy ~ 35976 (erg/g) and squareness ratio ~ 0.52 at 10 K. AC magnetic susceptibility study confirms the presence of spin glass state."
Work Function and Conductivity of Inkjet-Printed Silver Layers: Effect of Inks and Post-treatments,"The electronic properties of a printed layer are influenced by a number of factors, including the nature of the ink (nanoparticle- or solution-based), ink composition (solvents, additives, concentration), and post-treatment technologies, especially sintering. One of the major challenges in the field of printed electronics is achieving the desired performance, for example, in terms of conductivity, resistivity, or work function (WF). This work investigates the dependence of sheet resistance and WF on various sintering methodologies. Four different silver nanoparticle inks were inkjet-printed on a flexible polymeric foil and post-treated by thermal sintering (in an oven) or novel sintering processes using infrared or intense pulsed light. The surfaces of the printed and sintered layers were investigated optically, and various inhomogeneities in the layer surface were observed, varying from a smooth to a highly rough appearance with ring-shaped drying structures. An analysis of the sheet resistance revealed notable variation among the various inks and sintering methodologies used. Here, for the very first time, WF is measured and evaluated as a function of sintering methodology and silver ink, and the respective layer formation characteristics realized with the inkjet printing technology. The WF values obtained by ultraviolet photoemission show a similar spread and allow unambiguous trends to be tracked with respect to the type of ink and sintering method used. The values of the WF obtained range from 3.7 eV to 4.3 eV, approaching the reported bulk values of 4.3–4.7 eV. The various silver inks resulted in different WFs when the same sintering method was used, while the same silver ink resulted in different WFs when various sintering methods were applied. Therefore, it is believed that the WF can be tuned over a broad range in a controlled manner to satisfy electronic device requirements."
Recrystallization Behavior in SAC305 and SAC305 + 3.0POSS Solder Joints Under Thermal Shock,"Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) and SAC305 + 3.0 polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) ball grid array (BGA) assemblies have been prepared, observed, and subjected to thermal shock. The microstructure and grain orientation evolution of the solder joints located at the same position of the package were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattering diffraction, respectively. The results showed that the microstructure of the solder joints was refined by addition of POSS particles. In addition, compared with the single-grained or tricrystal joints normally observed in SAC305 BGA solder joints, the frequency of single-grained as-reflowed SAC305 + 3.0POSS BGA joints was greatly reduced, and the solder joints were typically composed of multicrystals with orientations separated by high-angle grain boundaries. These multicrystal joints appear to be obtained by dominant tricrystals or double tricrystals with deviation of the preferred [110] and \([1\bar{1}0]\) growth directions of Sn dendrites in Sn–Ag-based solder alloys during solidification from the melt. After 928 thermal shock cycles, the SAC305 solder joint had large-area recrystallization and cracks in contrast to the SAC305 + 3.0POSS solder joint located at the same position of the package, indicating that addition of POSS to SAC305 solder joints may contribute to postponement of recrystallization and subsequent crack initiation and propagation along recrystallized grain boundaries by pinning grain boundaries and movement of dislocations. This finding also confirms the double tricrystal solidification twinning nucleation behavior in Pb-free solder joints."
Monolayer Boron Nitride Substrate Interactions with Graphene Under In-Plane and Perpendicular Strains: A First-Principles Study,"Effects of strain on the electronic and optical properties of graphene on monolayer boron nitride (BN) substrate are investigated using first-principle calculations based on density functional theory. Strain-free graphene/BN has a small band gap of 97 meV at the K point. The magnitude of band gap increases with in-plane biaxial strain while it decreases with the perpendicular uniaxial strain. The \( \varepsilon_{2} (\omega ) \) spectrum of graphene/BN bilayer for parallel polarization shows red and blue shifts by applying the in-plane tensile and compressive strains, respectively. Also the positions of peaks in the \( \varepsilon_{2} (\omega ) \) spectrum are not significantly changed under perpendicular strain. The calculated results indicate that graphene on the BN substrate has great potential in microelectronic and optoelectronic applications."
Effect of Deformation Parameters on Microstructure and Properties During DIFT of X70HD Pipeline Steel,"Grain refinement is a critical approach to improve the strength of materials without damaging the toughness. The grains of deformation-induced ferrite are considerably smaller than those of proeutectoid ferrite. Grain refinement is crucial to the application of deformation-induced ferrite. The composition of ferrite and bainite or martensite is important in controlling the performance of X70HD pipeline steel, and cooling significantly influences the control of their ratio and grain size. By analyzing the static and dynamic phase-transition points using Gleeble-3800 thermal simulator, thermal simulations were performed through two-stage deformations in the austenite zone. Ferrite transformation rules were studied with thermal simulation tests under different deformation and cooling parameters based on the actual production of cumulative deformation. The influence of deformation parameters on the microstructure transformation was analyzed. Numerous fine-grain deformation-induced ferrites were obtained by regulating various parameters, including deformation temperature, strain rate, cooling rate, final cooling temperature and other parameters. Results of metallographic observation and microtensile testing revealed that the selection of appropriate parameters can refine the grains and improve the performance of the X70HD pipeline steel."

The Geometry of Cuboctahedra in Medieval Art in Anatolia,"Numerous examples of cuboctahedra found in medieval-era buildings whose dates range from the early twelfth to the early fifteenth century across in Turkey indicate the significant use of such geometrical entities. Here we focus particularly on cuboctahedra with carved-out surfaces. The results show that although the unit cell, which is a combination of cubes and tetrahedra, sufficiently explains all examples, the octahemioctahedron and stella octangula strengthen the possibility of tetrahedral packing with its dual network and indicate a “vector matrix”, as suggested by R. Buckminster Fuller. Therefore, their prevalent use as a “geometric solid” in a hollow cube frame and their appearance as an envelope of either tetrahedral packing or highly complex surfaces reveal almost 800-hundred-year-old examples of cuboctahedra as a Vector Equilibrium (VE) producing Isotropic Vector Matrix (IVM)."
Transfusion of Blood Products in the Neurocritical Care Unit: An Exploration of Rationing and Futility,"Rationing is the allocation of scarce resources, which in healthcare necessarily requires withholding potentially beneficial treatments from some individuals. While it often entails a negative connotation, rationing is unavoidable because need is limitless and resources are not. How rationing occurs is important, because it not only affects individual lives, but also reflects society’s most important values. At the core of any rationing, decision is how much a limited resource may benefit a patient, which can be particularly difficult to determine in the practice of neurocritical care, as prognosis is often uncertain. We present a case for the consideration of futility and blood product rationing in neurocritical care."
Foveation-based content adaptive root mean squared error for video quality assessment,"When the video is compressed and transmitted over heterogeneous networks, it is necessary to ensure the satisfying quality for the end user. Since human observers are the end users of video applications, it is very important that the human visual system (HVS) characteristics are taken into account during the video quality evaluation. This paper deals with video quality assessment (VQA) based on HVS characteristics and proposes a novel full-reference (FR) VQA metric called the Foveation-based content Adaptive Root Mean Squared Error (FARMSE). FARMSE uses several HVS characteristics that significantly influence perception of distortions in a video. Primarily these are foveated vision, reduction of the spatial acuity due to motions as well as spatial masking. Foveated vision is related to variable resolution of HVS across the viewing field, where the highest resolution is at the point of fixation. The point of fixation is projected onto the fovea – the area of retina with the highest density of photoreceptors. The part of image that falls on fovea is perceived by the highest acuity, whereas the spatial acuity decreases as the distance of the image part from the fovea increases. Spatial acuity further decreases if eyes cannot track moving objects. Both mentioned mechanisms influence contrast sensitivity of the HVS. Contrast sensitivity is frequency dependent and FARMSE uses Haar filters to utilize this dependence. Furthermore, spatial masking is implemented in each frequency channel. The FARMSE performance is compared to this of nine state-of-the-art VQA metrics on two different databases, LIVE and ECVQ. Additionally, the metrics are compared in terms of calculation complexity. The performed experiments show that FARMSE achieves high performance when predicting the quality of videos with different resolutions, degradation types and content types. FARMSE results outperform the results of most of the analyzed metrics, whereas they are comparable to these of the best publicly available metrics, including the well-known MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation (MOVIE) index. Besides that, FARMSE calculation complexity is significantly lower than that of the metrics comparable thereto in terms of prediction accuracy."
Critical analysis of Thailand’s past energy policies towards the development of a new energy policy,"This research originated from the researchers’ participation in the Thai senate Committee on Energy. It studies energy strategies and guidelines for Thailand’s energy development in line with the country’s potential, its energy resources as well as the needs of the Thai people with the ultimate goal to help bring about sustainable energy development. The research found that continuing dependence on natural gas crisis will pose a major threat with sustainable development of energy. According to its current power development plans, Thailand will likely increase its dependence on natural gas. The country should therefore diversify the use of energy sources since over-dependence on a single fuel will create risks to energy security, especially security of the fuels used in the generation of electricity. It is imperative to increase promotion of measures for energy conservation and energy efficiency, including measures to reduce fuel consumption and switching to renewable energy."
The Enterprising Self: a Panacea for all or New Fictitious Social Role for Older Adults? The Analysis of European Polices for Senior Entrepreneurship,"The purpose of the paper is to explore how policy narratives in European policy documents frame the image and role of a senior entrepreneur. This article includes a critical assessment of policy texts in two policy frameworks of European Union and OECD, namely: the active ageing framework and the inclusive entrepreneurship framework. The aim of this paper is to address two research questions: How is senior entrepreneurship framed in the European policies? What are the narratives of exclusion and inclusion construed in the European policies on senior entrepreneurship? Using the theoretical perspective of enterprising self and critical gerontology, the paper identifies two major narrations within which the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion operate: the hegemonic model of a senior entrepreneur and the economization of the model of senior entrepreneurship, with two sub-themes: the growth paradigm and the concept of entrepreneurial success. The recommendation for the future research and policy makers proposed in this paper is a more systematic development of life course sensitive policies with a more suitable mix of diverse approaches which would deescalate the existing inequalities."

Cdk5 Contributes to Huntington’s Disease Learning and Memory Deficits via Modulation of Brain Region-Specific Substrates,"Cognitive deficits are a major hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD) with a great impact on the quality of patient’s life. Gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory impairments in HD is, therefore, of critical importance. Cdk5 is a proline-directed Ser/Thr kinase involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory processes that has been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of Cdk5 in learning and memory impairments in HD using a novel animal model that expresses mutant huntingtin (mHtt) and has genetically reduced Cdk5 levels. Genetic reduction of Cdk5 in mHtt knock-in mice attenuated both corticostriatal learning deficits as well as hippocampal-dependent memory decline. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which Cdk5 counteracts the mHtt-induced learning and memory impairments appeared to be differentially regulated in a brain region-specific manner. While the corticostriatal learning deficits are attenuated through compensatory regulation of NR2B surface levels, the rescue of hippocampal-dependent memory was likely due to restoration of hippocampal dendritic spine density along with an increase in Rac1 activity. This work identifies Cdk5 as a critical contributor to mHtt-induced learning and memory deficits. Furthermore, we show that the Cdk5 downstream targets involved in memory and learning decline differ depending on the brain region analyzed suggesting that distinct Cdk5 effectors could be involved in cognitive impairments in HD."
C. Miller Fisher and the Comatose Patient,"Neurologic examination of the comatose patient has gradually matured. Less than 50 years ago, neurological examination in coma became a regular part of textbooks with separate chapters devoted to the topic but many were deficient in detail. In 1969, C.M. Fisher published an extraordinary 56-page paper on the examination of the comatose patient. The paper—one of Fisher’s gems—is not well known and infrequently cited. The many new observations collected in this comprehensive paper are reviewed in this vignette, which highlights not only how these contributions shaped our thinking on coma but also questioned shaky concepts."
An analysis of the impact of larger aircraft (A-380) on flight frequency,"Innovations in the airline industry can have a significant impact on the behavior of air transport stakeholders: airline companies, airports, and passengers. In this paper, we consider the introduction of a double-deck plane, the A-380, which is currently the largest aircraft available. Due to its size, it is able to carry at once approximately twice as many passengers as any other medium-sized aircraft. When associated with a reduction in flight frequencies, the operation of such aircraft is expected to lower the environmental impact. However, flight frequency depends on factors other than the aircraft size, such as airport fees, demand, and strategic decisions of companies to maximize their profits under competition. Using a monthly panel data set on airlines’ supply over 10 years, on 118 routes, we test if the use of the A-380 impacts airlines’ flight frequency at a route-level. Results suggest that heavy use of the A-380 leads airlines to reduce their own flight frequency. We also find that when facing the introduction of the A-380 on a route, airlines will tend to react by increasing their own flight frequency."
Solvent effect on the degree of (a)synchronicity in polar Diels-Alder reactions from the perspective of the reaction force constant analysis,"In this work, we computationally evaluated the influence of six different molecular solvents, described as a polarizable continuum model at the M06-2X/6–31+G(d,p) level, on the activation barrier/reaction rate, overall energy change, TS geometry, and degree of (a)synchronicity of two concerted Diels-Alder cycloadditions of acrolein (R1) and its complex with Lewis acid acrolein···BH3 (R2) to cyclopentadiene. In gas-phase, we found that both exothermicity and activation barrier are only reduced by about 2.0 kcal mol−1, and the asynchronicity character of the mechanism is accentuated when BH3 is included. An increment in the solvent’s polarity lowers the activation energy of R1 by 1.3 kcal mol−1, while for R2 the reaction rate is enhanced by more than 2000 times at room temperature (i.e., the activation energy decreases by 4.5 kcal mol−1) if the highest polar media is employed. Therefore, a synergistic effect is achieved when both external agents, i.e., Lewis acid catalyst and polar solvent, are included together. This effect was ascribed to the ability of the solvent to favor the encounter between cyclopentadiene and acrolein···BH3. This was validated by the asymmetry of the TS which becomes highly pronounced when either both or just BH3 is considered or the solvent’s polarity is increased. Finally, the reaction force constant κ(ξ) reveals that an increment in the solvent’s polarity is able to turn a moderate asynchronous mechanism of the formation of the new C-C σ-bonds into a highly asynchronous one."
"Dengue and yellow fever virus vectors: seasonal abundance, diversity and resting preferences in three Kenyan cities","The transmission patterns of dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, especially in urban settings, are influenced by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquito abundance and behavior. Despite recurrent dengue outbreaks on the Kenyan coast, these parameters remain poorly defined in this and other areas of contrasting dengue endemicity in Kenya. In assessing the transmission risk of DENV/YFV in three Kenyan cities, we determined adult abundance and resting habits of potential Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors in Kilifi (dengue-outbreak prone), and Nairobi and Kisumu (no dengue outbreaks reported). In addition, mosquito diversity, an important consideration for changing mosquito-borne disease dynamics, was compared."
FimAsartaN proTeinuriA SusTaIned reduCtion in comparison with losartan in diabetic chronic kidney disease (FANTASTIC): study protocol for randomized controlled trial,"Fimasartan is the ninth angiotensin receptor blocker to be developed. However, it has not yet been evaluated for reno-protective effects in hypertensive diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). The target blood pressure (BP) for hypertensive diabetic CKD is also a controversial topic. This trial was designed to assess the reno-protective effects of fimasartan compared to those of losartan as a primary outcome. This study also compares the two drugs with regard to cardiovascular and renal outcomes in accordance with target systolic BP (SBP) (as secondary outcomes)."
Comprehensive molecular biomarker identification in breast cancer brain metastases,Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) develop in about 20–30% of breast cancer (BC) patients. BCBM are associated with dismal prognosis not at least due to lack of valuable molecular therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to identify new molecular biomarkers and targets in BCBM by using complementary state-of-the-art techniques.
Hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter correlates with inactivation of MEG3 and poor prognosis in patients with retinoblastoma,"In our previous study, we revealed that MEG3 was a tumor suppressor gene in retinoblastoma and inhibited proliferation of retinoblastoma cells by regulating the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we further explored the mechanism of MEG3 inactivation in retinoblastoma."
"The impact of restoration processes on the selected soil properties and organic matter transformation of mountain fens under Caltho-Alnetum community in the Babiogórski National Park in Outer Flysch Carpathians, Poland",The objective of this study was to determine the impact of restoration processes on the selected soil properties and organic matter transformation of mountain fens under the Caltho-Alnetum community in the Babiogórski National Park in Outer Flysch Carpathians.
Ecosystem changes following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes in Japan: Future perspectives,"Major earthquakes cause widespread environmental and socioeconomic disruptions that persist for decades. Extensive ground disturbances that occurred during the shallow-focus Kumamoto earthquakes will affect future sustainability of ecosystem services west of Aso volcano. Numbers of earthquake-initiated landslides per unit area were higher in grasslands than forests, likely owing to greater root reinforcement of trees, and mostly initiated on ridgelines and/or convex/planar hillslopes. Most landslides traveled short distances and did not initially evolve into debris flows; resultant sediments and wood accumulating in headwater channels can be mobilized into debris flows during future storms. Fissures along ridgelines may promote water ingress and induce future landslides and debris flows that affect residents downstream. Native grasses are at risk because of habitat fragmentation caused by ground disturbances, extensive damage to rural roads, and abandonment of traditional pasture management practices. Sustainable management of affected areas needs to consider future risk of cascading hazards and long-term socioeconomic impacts."

Efficient immunodiagnosis of Citrus yellow mosaic virus using polyclonal antibodies with an expressed recombinant virion-associated protein,"Citrus yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) is a member of genus Badnavirus of the family Caulimoviridae. It is the causal agent of citrus yellow mosaic disease in citrus and causes reduction in yield. As the virus is vegetative propagated by grafting, development of high-throughput diagnosis methods based on serological techniques is a prerequisite for production of healthy virus-free planting material. The current study describes the development of polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against purified recombinant virion-associated protein (rVAP) encoded by ORF-II of CYMV. The specificity of developed antiserum was evaluated in immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM), antigen-coated plate-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and immunocapture PCR (IC-PCR). The antiserum specifically reacted up to a dilution of 1:2000 in ACP-ELISA for detection of CYMV-infected plants. The antiserum was validated by screening CYMV-infected plants maintained in the glass house through ACP-ELISA. To the best for our knowledge, this is the first report on production of polyclonal antiserum using recombinant virion-associated protein as fusion protein, which could be used for screening CYMV-infected plants by ELISA and IC-PCR. These immunodiagnostic methods can be effectively employed in routine indexing of citrus and in quarantine process."
Tuning of the active phase structure and hydrofining performance of alumina-supported tri-metallic WMoNi catalysts via phosphorus incorporation,"The effects of phosphorus on the structure and hydrofining performance of tri-metallic WMoNi/Al2O3 catalysts prepared with W/Mo-based hybrid precursor nanocrystals were investigated. The incorporation of phosphorus weakened the metal-support interactions (MSIs) and facilitated the formation of more synergetic NiWMoS phases with higher stacks. Catalytic tests using a fluid catalytic cracking diesel fuel showed that the changes in the MSIs and the morphology of the active phases had a more positive effect on the hydrodenitrogenation activity than on the hydrodesulfurization activity. In contrast, when phosphorus was incorporated into a tri-metallic WMoNiP/ Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a conventional incipient impregnation method, the MSIs decreased causing aggregation of the metal species which resulted in poorer hydrofining performance of the catalyst. These results show that incorporating phosphorus into a WMoNi/Al2O3 catalyst can finely tune the structure of the active phase to enhance the hydrogenation and hydrodenitrogenation activity of the resulting tri-metallic catalyst."
Dendritic Boundary Corrosion of AA2198 Weld Using Fiber Laser Welding with Al–Cu Filler Wire,"The microstructures and corrosion behaviors of AA2198–T851 alloy and weld were analyzed under corrosive conditions. Weld was formed using an innovative fiber laser welding process with AA2319 Al–Cu filler wire. The metallurgic morphology and distribution of the chemical compositions were determined using imaging techniques such as optical micrograph, scanning electron micrograph, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. Corrosion was evaluated using an immersion test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 3.5% NaCl solution at room temperature. Results indicate that the parent alloy suffered from pitting corrosion during the initial 4-h immersion which was caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of its chemical components and the different intermetallics formed during the rolling process. The weld experienced dendritic boundary corrosion under the same conditions due to the addition of the Al–Cu filler and rapid solidification during laser welding, which led to the precipitates Cu enrichment along the grain boundary. When a welding joint was immersed in the solution for 5 days, a big crack was observed across the center of the weld. In comparison, there was good corrosion resistance in the heat-affected zone with a compact protective film."
Analyzing Effect of System Inertia on Grid Frequency Forecasting Usnig Two Stage Neuro-Fuzzy System,"Frequency forecasting is an important aspect of power system operation. The system frequency varies with load-generation imbalance. Frequency variation depends upon various parameters including system inertia. System inertia determines the rate of fall of frequency after the disturbance in the grid. Though, inertia of the system is not considered while forecasting the frequency of power system during planning and operation. This leads to significant errors in forecasting. In this paper, the effect of inertia on frequency forecasting is analysed for a particular grid system. In this paper, a parameter equivalent to system inertia is introduced. This parameter is used to forecast the frequency of a typical power grid for any instant of time. The system gives appreciable result with reduced error ."
A note on generalized derivations on prime rings,Let R be a prime ring with the extended centroid C and symmetric Martindale quotient ring \(Q_s(R)\). In this paper we prove the following result. Let \(F: R \rightarrow R\) be a generalized derivation associated with a non-zero derivation d on R and let h be an additive map of R such that \(F(x)x=xh(x)\) for all \(x\in R\). Then either R is commutative or \(F(x)=xp\) and \(h(x)=px\) where \(p\in Q_{s}(R)\).
Analysis of precision and accuracy in a simple model of machine learning,"Machine learning is a procedure where a model for the world is constructed from a training set of examples. It is important that the model should capture relevant features of the training set, and at the same time make correct prediction for examples not included in the training set. I consider the polynomial regression, the simplest method of learning, and analyze the accuracy and precision for different levels of the model complexity."
Effects of an in vacancy on local distortion of fast phase transition in Bi-doped In3SbTe2,"Indium vacancies in Bi-doped In3SbTe2 (BIST) cause local distortion or and faster phase transition of BIST with good stability. The formation energy of the In vacancy in the BIST is relatively lower compared to that in IST due to triple negative charge state of the In vacancy (V
3−
In) and higher concentration of the V
3−
In in BIST. The band gap of BIST is substantially reduced with increasing concentrations of the V
3−
In and the hole carriers, which results in a higher electrical conductivity. The phase-change memory (PRAM) device fabricated with the BIST shows very fast, stable switching characteristics at lower voltages."
"Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with In2S3 buffer layer deposited by thermal evaporation","We report on physical vapor deposition of indium sulfide (In2S3) buffer layers and its application to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin film solar cell. The Indium sulfide buffer layers were evaporated onto CIGSe at various substrate temperatures from room temperature (RT) to 350 °C. The effect of deposition temperature of buffer layers on the solar cell device performance were investigated by analyzing temperature dependent current-voltage (J-V-T), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and Raman spectroscopy. The fabricated device showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 6.56% at substrate temperature of 250 °C, which is due to the decreased interface recombination. However, the roll-over in J-V curves was observed for solar cell device having buffer deposited at substrate temperature larger than 250 °C. From the measurement results, the interface defect and roll-over related degradation were found to have limitation on the performance of solar cell device."
Effects of mesoscale eddies on the variation of water exchange through the Kerama Gap,"The Kerama Gap is an important passage for water exchange between the East China Sea (ECS) and the northwestern Pacific (NP). The mean Kerama Gap transport (KGT) is small into the ECS (~ 2.0 Sv) but with a large standard deviation (~ 4.5 Sv), which has a significant influence on the variation of Kuroshio transport. The effects of mesoscale eddies on the variation of KGT are investigated by using a 25-year Pacific Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model from 1979 to 2003. Model results show that the variation of KGT is mainly determined by the variation of sea level difference between the northeast and southwest of the Kerama Gap, and these differences are dominated by the westward propagating mesoscale eddies. The effects of mesoscale eddies depend on the meridional location of these eddies. When the anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy is located in the northeast of the Kerama Gap or the cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy is located in the southwest of the Kerama Gap, the KGT shows a strong positive (negative) anomaly. However, when the eddy is located in the central region of the Kerama Gap, the KGT shows a relatively smaller anomaly. Besides, the variation of Kuroshio, strongly influenced by the eddies east of Taiwan, also plays an important role in influencing the variation of KGT. When the Kuroshio transport crossing the upstream section of the Kerama Gap is high (low) or the Kuroshio central position shifts to (away from) the Kerama Gap there will be more (less) water flow from the ECS to the NP."
Organic mulch sheet formulation as an effort to help plants adapt to climate change,"This study aimed to discover the precise material composition and thickness (water hyacinth, rice straw, and banana pseudostem) of organic mulch sheet."
Antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic stewardship programs in the ICU: insistence and persistence in the fight against resistance. A position statement from ESICM/ESCMID/WAAAR round table on multi-drug resistance,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a clear and present danger to patients in any intensive care unit (ICU) around the world.  Whereas AMR may affect any patient in the hospital, patients in the ICU are particularly at risk of acquiring AMR infections due to the intensity of the treatment, use of invasive devices, increased risk of transmission and exposure to antibiotics.  AMR is present in every ICU, although prevalence is geographically different and AMR pathogens encountered are variable.  Intensive care and infectious disease specialists from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, European Society of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and World Alliance Against Antimicrobial Resistance,  united in the ANTARCTICA (Antimicrobial Resistance in Critical Care) coalition, call for increased awareness and action among health care professionals to reduce AMR development in critically ill patients, to improve treatment of AMR infections and to coordinate scientific research in this high-risk patient population.  Close collaboration with other specialties, and combining these and other interventions in antibiotic stewardship programmes should be a priority in every ICU. Considerate antibiotic use and adopting strict infection control practices to halt AMR remains a responsibility shared by all healthcare workers, from physicians to maintenance personnel, from nurses to physiotherapists, from consultants to medical students. Together, we can reduce AMR in our ICUs and continue to treat our patients effectively."
User selection for collaboration in product development based on QFD and DEA approach,"User collaboration has been recognized as a critical factor in successful product development. To select the proper users who have a higher satisfaction to meet product development requirements, this study proposes an integrated approach based on quality function deployment (QFD) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed approach considers product development requirements, the inner dependencies of user evaluation criteria, and the relationships between requirements and criteria simultaneously and presents them in house of quality (HoQ). For the fuzzy and imprecise information in HoQ, fuzzy weighted average method is employed to determine the weight of each user evaluation criterion. Furthermore, to determine the priorities of users with a large number efficiently, this study implements linguistic variables to assess the weight of each user under each criterion, the DEA method to determine the optimal values of linguistic variables, and the simple additive weighting approach to aggregate the weight of each criteria and the local score of each user with respect to each criterion. An illustrative case is presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed approach based on QFD and DEA in this paper."
What a difference a day makes: inequality and the tax and benefit system from a long-run perspective,"Most analyses of inequality and tax and benefit reforms are based on measures of individuals’ circumstances at a point in time. But strong age-profiles in earnings, among other characteristics that the tax and benefit system conditions upon, combined with individuals’ ability to transfer resources across time suggests that measuring circumstances over longer horizons may lead to a very different picture. In this article, we consider how our impression of inequality and the tax and benefit system changes when the horizon under consideration is extended. We show that inequality is lower, redistribution less extensive, and benefit receipt far more widespread from a longer-run perspective. The choice of accounting period can also lead to a very different assessment of the distributional impact of policy reforms. Our results show the importance of policymakers explicitly considering what it is they are trying to achieve through redistribution: the alleviation of short-run hardship or the reduction of lifetime inequality. While there may be good reasons to pursue both objectives, the group of people affected and the appropriate policy response will differ depending on which is prioritized."
"Assessment of spatial distribution of contaminants and their levels in soil and water resources of Calabar, Nigeria using geophysical and geological data","The contamination levels of soils and water resources in Calabar, Nigeria have been investigated using resistivity (vertical electrical sounding and electrical resistivity tomography), geochemical analyses of soil and water resources and textural analysis. Sixty randomly sited VES sites were investigated in two seasons while ERT investigations were performed along four profiles. The geochemical investigations were spread across seasons in order to track seasonal changes in physico-chemical parameters: hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, chloride ion (Cl−), nitrate ion (\( {\text{NO}}_{ 3}^{ - } \)), bicarbonate (\( {\text{HCO}}_{ 3}^{ - } \)), sulphate ion (\( {\text{SO}}_{ 4}^{2 - } \)), calcium ion (Ca2+), sodium ion (Na+), potassium ion (K+) and magnesium ion (Mg2+). Additionally, concentrations of ammonium, aluminium and nitrite ions in soils were determined. Results show that ionic concentrations in the sand-dominated soils and water are within permissible limits and baseline standards. The resistivities follow known trends in the area. However, at the central waste disposal site, a localised thin (< 5 m), low resistivity (< 15 Ωm) anomaly suspected to be due to contamination by leachates was observed. Comparatively, the contaminated area is also characterised by marginal increase in ionic concentrations. Strong attenuation capacities of overlying and adjoining clay/lateritic sediments and optimal design of the waste dump site probably reduced the spread of contaminants. The contaminated zone need to be closely monitored so that it does not extend to the aquifers. Hence, all strategies presently being used in managing wastes in Calabar should be sustained."
Transport behavior of nZnO in geosynthetic clay liner used in municipal solid waste landfills under temperature effect,"The transport process of nZnO in geosynthetic clay liner (GCL), an anti-seepage material used in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, under different seepage temperature conditions was conducted. The transport behavior of nZnO in GCL was analyzed. Results showed that the retardation performance of current GCL used in MSW landfills anti-seepage system against nZnO pollutants was poor. nZnO successfully permeated the GCL and entered external soil–groundwater environment, posing health threats to the life of organisms. Although seepage temperature exerted a small effect on nZnO suspension leakage volume, change in seepage temperature affects the mass of transported nZnO in GCL by redispersion of nZnO in suspension. As the seepage temperature increases, the mass of nZnO that permeated the GCL increases, reaching a maximum at 50 °C, and then decreases."
Entropy of black holes in \(\mathcal {N}=2\) supergravity,"Using the formalism of isolated horizons, we construct space of solutions of asymptotically flat extremal black holes in \(\mathcal {N}=2\) pure supergravity in 4 dimensions. We prove that the laws of black hole mechanics hold for these black holes. Further, restricting to constant area phase space, we show that the spherical horizons admit a Chern–Simons theory. Standard way of quantizing this topological theory and counting states confirms that entropy is indeed proportional to the area of horizon."
Two-photon fabrication of hydrogel microstructures for excitation and immobilization of cells,"We investigate in vitro fabrication of hydrogel microstructures by two photon laser lithography for single cell immobilization and excitation. Fluorescent yeast cells are embedded in water containing the hydrogel precursor mixtures and cross-linking is used to selectively immobilize a particular cell. Cell viability within the hydrogel precursor is estimated using a life/dead assay and elastic and stiff hydrogel structures are fabricated, immobilizing cells in a microfluidic environment. Additionally, we demonstrate the illumination of cells by on-the-fly fabricated hydrogel waveguide networks connected to an external light source, thereby exciting a fluorescence signal in a single immobilized cell."
On resonant separatrix layers of a twin-well Duffing oscillator,"In this paper, resonant separatrix layers in the Duffing oscillator with a twin-well potential are investigated through the energy incremental spectrum, and the corresponding parameter maps are also obtained. For the (\(2n-1{:}1\))-resonant layers outside the potential wells, the existence domain in parameter map becomes large with increasing excitation amplitude or frequency. For the (m : 1)-resonant layers inside the potential wells, the existence domain in the parameter map is closed because the maximum natural frequency in the potential well is finite. The Poincaré mapping sections for appearance and disappearance of resonant layers are carried out. For a specific resonant layer, with increasing excitation frequency and amplitude, the saddle and centers of the resonant layer are not on the same resonant orbit, which should be further investigated."
A network modeling approach to elucidate drug resistance mechanisms and predict combinatorial drug treatments in breast cancer,"Mechanistic models of within-cell signal transduction networks can explain how these networks integrate internal and external inputs to give rise to the appropriate cellular response. These models can be fruitfully used in cancer cells, whose aberrant decision-making regarding their survival or death, proliferation or quiescence can be connected to errors in the state of nodes or edges of the signal transduction network."
The CogBIAS longitudinal study protocol: cognitive and genetic factors influencing psychological functioning in adolescence,Optimal psychological development is dependent upon a complex interplay between individual and situational factors. Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The CogBIAS longitudinal study (CogBIAS-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample.
Core Body Temperature but Not Intraabdominal Pressure Predicts Postoperative Complications Following Closed-System Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) Administration,"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) following cytoreductive surgery (CRS), performed using closed-abdomen technique (CAT), may affect intraabdominal pressure (IAP). High IAP may increase postoperative complications due to decreased venous return and hypoperfusion to vital organs. Elevated core body temperature (CBT) may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Low IAP or CBT could result in suboptimal HIPEC and potentially translate into early disease recurrence. The aim of the present study is to identify possible correlations between IAP or CBT and postoperative complications."
A long-term survival case treated with conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy for pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis,"Pancreatic cancer with distant metastases is classified as “unresectable,” for which the standard treatment is systemic chemotherapy. The effectiveness of radical resection for pancreatic cancer with distant metastases is unknown. Here, we report a case of long term survival treated with conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy for pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis."
PCI is Not Predictive of Survival After Complete CRS/HIPEC in Peritoneal Dissemination from High-Grade Appendiceal Primaries,Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) is a treatment option in patients with carcinomatosis from high-grade appendiceal (HGA) primaries. It is unknown if there is a Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI) upper limit above which a complete CRS/HIPEC does not assure long-term survival.
Association of Delivery System Integration and Outcomes for Major Cancer Surgery,"Integrated delivery systems (IDSs) are postulated to reduce spending and improve outcomes through successful coordination of care across multiple providers. Nonetheless, the actual impact of IDSs on outcomes for complex multidisciplinary care such as major cancer surgery is largely unknown."
Designation of fingerprint glycopeptides for targeted glycoproteomic analysis of serum haptoglobin: insights into gastric cancer biomarker discovery,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, largely because of difficulties in early diagnosis. Despite accumulating evidence indicating that aberrant glycosylation is associated with GC, site-specific localization of the glycosylation to increase specificity and sensitivity for clinical use is still an analytical challenge. Here, we created an analytical platform with a targeted glycoproteomic approach for GC biomarker discovery. Unlike the conventional glycomic approach with untargeted mass spectrometric profiling of released glycan, our platform is characterized by three key features: it is a target-protein-specific, glycosylation-site-specific, and structure-specific platform with a one-shot enzyme reaction. Serum haptoglobin enriched by immunoaffinity chromatography was subjected to multispecific proteolysis to generate site-specific glycopeptides and to investigate the macroheterogeneity and microheterogeneity. Glycopeptides were identified and quantified by nano liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and nano liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Ninety-six glycopeptides, each corresponding to a unique glycan/glycosite pairing, were tracked across all cancer and control samples. Differences in abundance between the two groups were marked by particularly high magnitudes. Three glycopeptides exhibited exceptionally high control-to-cancer fold changes along with receiver operating characteristic curve areas of 1.0, indicating perfect discrimination between the two groups. From the results taken together, our platform, which provides biological information as well as high sensitivity and reproducibility, may be useful for GC biomarker discovery."
Anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of Calendula officinalis on inflammatory bone loss in rats,The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of Calendula officinalis (CLO) on alveolar bone loss (ABL) in rats.
Transfusion of Blood Products in the Neurocritical Care Unit: An Exploration of Rationing and Futility,"Rationing is the allocation of scarce resources, which in healthcare necessarily requires withholding potentially beneficial treatments from some individuals. While it often entails a negative connotation, rationing is unavoidable because need is limitless and resources are not. How rationing occurs is important, because it not only affects individual lives, but also reflects society’s most important values. At the core of any rationing, decision is how much a limited resource may benefit a patient, which can be particularly difficult to determine in the practice of neurocritical care, as prognosis is often uncertain. We present a case for the consideration of futility and blood product rationing in neurocritical care."
C. Miller Fisher and the Comatose Patient,"Neurologic examination of the comatose patient has gradually matured. Less than 50 years ago, neurological examination in coma became a regular part of textbooks with separate chapters devoted to the topic but many were deficient in detail. In 1969, C.M. Fisher published an extraordinary 56-page paper on the examination of the comatose patient. The paper—one of Fisher’s gems—is not well known and infrequently cited. The many new observations collected in this comprehensive paper are reviewed in this vignette, which highlights not only how these contributions shaped our thinking on coma but also questioned shaky concepts."
Cdk5 Contributes to Huntington’s Disease Learning and Memory Deficits via Modulation of Brain Region-Specific Substrates,"Cognitive deficits are a major hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD) with a great impact on the quality of patient’s life. Gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory impairments in HD is, therefore, of critical importance. Cdk5 is a proline-directed Ser/Thr kinase involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory processes that has been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of Cdk5 in learning and memory impairments in HD using a novel animal model that expresses mutant huntingtin (mHtt) and has genetically reduced Cdk5 levels. Genetic reduction of Cdk5 in mHtt knock-in mice attenuated both corticostriatal learning deficits as well as hippocampal-dependent memory decline. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which Cdk5 counteracts the mHtt-induced learning and memory impairments appeared to be differentially regulated in a brain region-specific manner. While the corticostriatal learning deficits are attenuated through compensatory regulation of NR2B surface levels, the rescue of hippocampal-dependent memory was likely due to restoration of hippocampal dendritic spine density along with an increase in Rac1 activity. This work identifies Cdk5 as a critical contributor to mHtt-induced learning and memory deficits. Furthermore, we show that the Cdk5 downstream targets involved in memory and learning decline differ depending on the brain region analyzed suggesting that distinct Cdk5 effectors could be involved in cognitive impairments in HD."
Foveation-based content adaptive root mean squared error for video quality assessment,"When the video is compressed and transmitted over heterogeneous networks, it is necessary to ensure the satisfying quality for the end user. Since human observers are the end users of video applications, it is very important that the human visual system (HVS) characteristics are taken into account during the video quality evaluation. This paper deals with video quality assessment (VQA) based on HVS characteristics and proposes a novel full-reference (FR) VQA metric called the Foveation-based content Adaptive Root Mean Squared Error (FARMSE). FARMSE uses several HVS characteristics that significantly influence perception of distortions in a video. Primarily these are foveated vision, reduction of the spatial acuity due to motions as well as spatial masking. Foveated vision is related to variable resolution of HVS across the viewing field, where the highest resolution is at the point of fixation. The point of fixation is projected onto the fovea – the area of retina with the highest density of photoreceptors. The part of image that falls on fovea is perceived by the highest acuity, whereas the spatial acuity decreases as the distance of the image part from the fovea increases. Spatial acuity further decreases if eyes cannot track moving objects. Both mentioned mechanisms influence contrast sensitivity of the HVS. Contrast sensitivity is frequency dependent and FARMSE uses Haar filters to utilize this dependence. Furthermore, spatial masking is implemented in each frequency channel. The FARMSE performance is compared to this of nine state-of-the-art VQA metrics on two different databases, LIVE and ECVQ. Additionally, the metrics are compared in terms of calculation complexity. The performed experiments show that FARMSE achieves high performance when predicting the quality of videos with different resolutions, degradation types and content types. FARMSE results outperform the results of most of the analyzed metrics, whereas they are comparable to these of the best publicly available metrics, including the well-known MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation (MOVIE) index. Besides that, FARMSE calculation complexity is significantly lower than that of the metrics comparable thereto in terms of prediction accuracy."
Interactions between bradykinin and plasmin in the endothelial Ca2+ response,"Plasmin is a fibrinolytic factor and a serine protease that activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) to produce endothelium-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Nitric oxide and prostacyclin production is regulated, at least in part, by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in various blood vessel types. Bradykinin and plasmin stimulate vascular endothelial cells and work simultaneously in pathophysiological conditions such as thrombosis and inflammation. Here, we explored the interactions between bradykinin and plasmin in the endothelial Ca2+ response using the fluorescent indicator, Fura-2/AM, in primary cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs). Plasmin (0.15–15 µg/ml) and bradykinin (0.1–10 nM) increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in PAECs in a dose-dependent manner, and the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response occurred only once. Bradykinin (0.1–10 nM) inhibited the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner, however, plasmin did not affect the bradykinin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response. Pretreatment with gabexate mesilate (GM, 100 µM), a serine protease inhibitor, that blocks plasmin’s proteolytic activity, fully suppressed the plasmin-induced Ca2+ response. After washout of GM and the first plasmin, the second administration of plasmin caused Ca2+ increases. However, when the first plasmin-induced Ca2+ response was blocked by pretreatment with bradykinin, the second plasmin (15 µg/ml) application did not cause any Ca2+ response, even 30 min after the washout of the first plasmin and bradykinin. Our data suggested that bradykinin regulated the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response by inhibiting the pathway downstream of the PARs’ N-terminus cleavage."
An analysis of the impact of larger aircraft (A-380) on flight frequency,"Innovations in the airline industry can have a significant impact on the behavior of air transport stakeholders: airline companies, airports, and passengers. In this paper, we consider the introduction of a double-deck plane, the A-380, which is currently the largest aircraft available. Due to its size, it is able to carry at once approximately twice as many passengers as any other medium-sized aircraft. When associated with a reduction in flight frequencies, the operation of such aircraft is expected to lower the environmental impact. However, flight frequency depends on factors other than the aircraft size, such as airport fees, demand, and strategic decisions of companies to maximize their profits under competition. Using a monthly panel data set on airlines’ supply over 10 years, on 118 routes, we test if the use of the A-380 impacts airlines’ flight frequency at a route-level. Results suggest that heavy use of the A-380 leads airlines to reduce their own flight frequency. We also find that when facing the introduction of the A-380 on a route, airlines will tend to react by increasing their own flight frequency."
Critical analysis of Thailand’s past energy policies towards the development of a new energy policy,"This research originated from the researchers’ participation in the Thai senate Committee on Energy. It studies energy strategies and guidelines for Thailand’s energy development in line with the country’s potential, its energy resources as well as the needs of the Thai people with the ultimate goal to help bring about sustainable energy development. The research found that continuing dependence on natural gas crisis will pose a major threat with sustainable development of energy. According to its current power development plans, Thailand will likely increase its dependence on natural gas. The country should therefore diversify the use of energy sources since over-dependence on a single fuel will create risks to energy security, especially security of the fuels used in the generation of electricity. It is imperative to increase promotion of measures for energy conservation and energy efficiency, including measures to reduce fuel consumption and switching to renewable energy."
New normalized nonlocal hybrid level set method for image segmentation,"This article introduces a new normalized nonlocal hybrid level set method for image segmentation. Due to intensity overlapping, blurred edges with complex backgrounds, simple intensity and texture information, such kind of image segmentation is still a challenging task. The proposed method uses both the region and boundary information to achieve accurate segmentation results. The region information can help to identify rough region of interest and prevent the boundary leakage problem. It makes use of normalized nonlocal comparisons between pairs of patches in each region, and a heuristic intensity model is proposed to suppress irrelevant strong edges and constrain the segmentation. The boundary information can help to detect the precise location of the target object, it makes use of the geodesic active contour model to obtain the target boundary. The corresponding variational segmentation problem is implemented by a level set formulation. We use an internal energy term for geometric active contours to penalize the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function. At last, experimental results on synthetic images and real images are shown in the paper with promising results."
Ascorbic acid: still controversial when used against cancer resistance?,"Ascorbic acid is known to be a strong antioxidant that exerts pro-oxidative effects at high concentrations and/or dosages. Therefore, it can be used as a protective agent and as an adjuvant or direct cytotoxic agent. Cancer cell resistance is a well-known issue, which encourages scientists to search for ways to fight it. The use of ascorbic acid against cancer resistance remains controversial. This paper outlines the potential use of ascorbic acid in cancer resistance, especially resistance due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although it is hoped that this vitamin is useful in this setting, more research is needed."
The Manchester-Fothergill procedure versus vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension: a matched historical cohort study,This study compares vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension (VH) with the Manchester-Fothergill procedure (MP) for treating pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in the apical compartment.
The convergence ball and error analysis of the two-step Secant method,"Under the assumption that the nonlinear operator has Lipschitz continuous divided differences for the first order, we obtain an estimate of the radius of the convergence ball for the two-step secant method. Moreover, we also provide an error estimate that matches the convergence order of the two-step secant method. At last, we give an application of the proposed theorem."
When q theory meets large losses risks and agency conflicts,"We incorporate large losses risks into the DeMarzo et al.(2012) model of dynamic agency and the q theory of investment. The large losses risks induce losses costs and losses arising from agency conflicts during the large losses prevention process. Both of them reduce firm’s value, distort investment policy and generate a deeper wedge between the marginal and average q. In addition, we study the implementation of the contract to enhance the practical utility of our model. The agent optimally manages the firm’s cash flow and treats the cash reservation and credit line as the firm’s financial slack, and hedges the productivity shocks and large losses shocks via futures and insurance contracts, respectively."
Twisted cubics on singular cubic fourfolds—On Starr’s fibration,We show that the Hilbert scheme compactification of the total space of Starr’s fibration on the space of twisted cubics on a cubic hypersurface in \({\mathbb P}^5\) not containing a plane admits a contraction to a singular projective symplectic variety of dimension eight which has a crepant resolution deformation equivalent to the symplectic eightfold constructed from twisted cubics on a smooth cubic fourfold. This yields another proof that the symplectic eightfold and the Hilbert scheme of four points on a K3 surface are deformation equivalent. As a byproduct we obtain similar results for the variety of lines on a singular cubic fourfold.
Designation of fingerprint glycopeptides for targeted glycoproteomic analysis of serum haptoglobin: insights into gastric cancer biomarker discovery,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, largely because of difficulties in early diagnosis. Despite accumulating evidence indicating that aberrant glycosylation is associated with GC, site-specific localization of the glycosylation to increase specificity and sensitivity for clinical use is still an analytical challenge. Here, we created an analytical platform with a targeted glycoproteomic approach for GC biomarker discovery. Unlike the conventional glycomic approach with untargeted mass spectrometric profiling of released glycan, our platform is characterized by three key features: it is a target-protein-specific, glycosylation-site-specific, and structure-specific platform with a one-shot enzyme reaction. Serum haptoglobin enriched by immunoaffinity chromatography was subjected to multispecific proteolysis to generate site-specific glycopeptides and to investigate the macroheterogeneity and microheterogeneity. Glycopeptides were identified and quantified by nano liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and nano liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Ninety-six glycopeptides, each corresponding to a unique glycan/glycosite pairing, were tracked across all cancer and control samples. Differences in abundance between the two groups were marked by particularly high magnitudes. Three glycopeptides exhibited exceptionally high control-to-cancer fold changes along with receiver operating characteristic curve areas of 1.0, indicating perfect discrimination between the two groups. From the results taken together, our platform, which provides biological information as well as high sensitivity and reproducibility, may be useful for GC biomarker discovery."
A counterforce to diversion of cerebrospinal fluid during ventriculoperitoneal shunting: the intraperitoneal pressure. An observational study,"Intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) counteracts the diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the cranial to the peritoneal compartment during ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Animal studies suggest that the intrinsic IPP exceeds the intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure. The intrinsic IPP in mobile patients is relevant for shunt therapy, but data about it is not available."
Endoscopic transorbital route to the petrous apex: a feasibility anatomic study,"While the subtemporal approach represents the surgical module milestone designed to reach the petrous apex, a novel ventral route, which is the superior eyelid endoscopic transorbital approach, has been proposed to access the skull base. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of this route to the petrous apex, providing a qualitative and quantitative analysis of this relatively novel pathway."
"Microalgae-mediated brewery wastewater treatment: effect of dilution rate on nutrient removal rates, biomass biochemical composition, and cell physiology","Microalgae have been used to remove nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from brewery wastewater (BWW). The microalga Scenedesmus obliquus was grown on BWW, using bubble column photobioreactors that operated under batch and continuous regimes. For the first time, the cell physiological status cell membrane integrity and enzymatic activity was monitored during the microalgae based BWW treatment, using flow cytometry. All the cultivations batch and continuous displayed a proportion of cells with intact membrane > 87%, although the continuous cultivations displayed a lower proportion of cells with enzymatic activity (20–40%) than the batch cultivations (97%). The dilution rate of 0.26 day−1 was the most favorable condition, since the microalgae cultivation attained the maximum biomass productivity (0.2 g ash-free dry weight day−1) and the total nitrogen and COD removal rates were the highest (97 and 74%, respectively), while the phosphorous removal rate was the third (23%)."
"Mapping and screening of the tomato Stemphylium lycopersici resistance gene, Sm, based on bulked segregant analysis in combination with genome resequencing","Tomato gray leaf spot disease caused by Stemphylium lycopersici (S. lycopersici) is considered one of the major diseases of cultivated tomatoes. The only S. lycopersici resistance gene, Sm, was derived from the wild tomato species S. pimpinellifolium. Sm has been identified as an effective source of gray leaf spot resistance in tomatoes and has been mapped to tomato chromosome 11. In this study, the first bulked segregant analysis (BSA) combined with genome resequencing for the mapping and screening of the Sm candidate gene was performed."
User selection for collaboration in product development based on QFD and DEA approach,"User collaboration has been recognized as a critical factor in successful product development. To select the proper users who have a higher satisfaction to meet product development requirements, this study proposes an integrated approach based on quality function deployment (QFD) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed approach considers product development requirements, the inner dependencies of user evaluation criteria, and the relationships between requirements and criteria simultaneously and presents them in house of quality (HoQ). For the fuzzy and imprecise information in HoQ, fuzzy weighted average method is employed to determine the weight of each user evaluation criterion. Furthermore, to determine the priorities of users with a large number efficiently, this study implements linguistic variables to assess the weight of each user under each criterion, the DEA method to determine the optimal values of linguistic variables, and the simple additive weighting approach to aggregate the weight of each criteria and the local score of each user with respect to each criterion. An illustrative case is presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed approach based on QFD and DEA in this paper."
Maternal educational level and the risk of persistent post-partum glucose metabolism disorders in women with gestational diabetes mellitus,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs in 5–15% of pregnancies, and lower maternal educational attainment has been associated with higher risk of GDM. We aimed to determine if maternal education level is associated with persistent post-partum glucose metabolism disorders in women with GDM."
"Descriptive statistics and risk assessment for the control of seasonal pollutant effects of 210Po and 210Pb in coastal waters (Çanakkale, Turkey)","210Po is absorbed into the human body by seafood intake. Especially, mollusks and mussels are known to have much higher 210Po concentration than fish among various other types of seafood and are consumed in large quantities in Aegean Sea. 210Po and 210Pb radionuclide concentrations are obtained in the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and in the sediment samples collected from the Çanakkale. The activity concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb are counted using alpha spectrometry. Activity concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb in mussels are in the ranged of 227 ± 11–540 ± 38 and 17 ± 4–48 ± 5 Bq kg−1 dw (dry weight), for sediments the ranges are 23 ± 6–41 ± 3 and 15 ± 3–44 ± 1 Bq kg−1 dw, respectively. Additionally, annual committed effective dose are calculated due to consumption mussel in Çanakkale coastal region. The highest effective doses of 210Po and 210Po are found as 3187 and 56 μSv, respectively. Finally, risk analysis assessment is recommended to determine the pollutant effects of radionuclides. The risk fractions at the concentrations are easily determined with this evaluation process. This methodology has made a great contribution to risk assessments."
Interactions between bradykinin and plasmin in the endothelial Ca2+ response,"Plasmin is a fibrinolytic factor and a serine protease that activates protease-activated receptors (PARs) to produce endothelium-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Nitric oxide and prostacyclin production is regulated, at least in part, by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in various blood vessel types. Bradykinin and plasmin stimulate vascular endothelial cells and work simultaneously in pathophysiological conditions such as thrombosis and inflammation. Here, we explored the interactions between bradykinin and plasmin in the endothelial Ca2+ response using the fluorescent indicator, Fura-2/AM, in primary cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs). Plasmin (0.15–15 µg/ml) and bradykinin (0.1–10 nM) increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in PAECs in a dose-dependent manner, and the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response occurred only once. Bradykinin (0.1–10 nM) inhibited the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner, however, plasmin did not affect the bradykinin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response. Pretreatment with gabexate mesilate (GM, 100 µM), a serine protease inhibitor, that blocks plasmin’s proteolytic activity, fully suppressed the plasmin-induced Ca2+ response. After washout of GM and the first plasmin, the second administration of plasmin caused Ca2+ increases. However, when the first plasmin-induced Ca2+ response was blocked by pretreatment with bradykinin, the second plasmin (15 µg/ml) application did not cause any Ca2+ response, even 30 min after the washout of the first plasmin and bradykinin. Our data suggested that bradykinin regulated the plasmin-induced endothelial Ca2+ response by inhibiting the pathway downstream of the PARs’ N-terminus cleavage."
Corporate governance and social norms during financial crisis: evidence from France and Saudi Arabia,"The resistance to financial crisis and compliance with social norms and effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms is considered recently as a good matter of concern. Focusing on differences between French and Saudi firms, we examine the effect of (1) board of directors, (2) audit committee, (3) compliance with Corporate Social Responsibility activities, (4) compliance with Shariah principles on financial volatility during subprime crisis of 2007. We find that larger boards, larger audit committees, independent members on boards and audit committees are related negatively to financial volatility. The result supports corporate governance theory which suggests that corporate governance variables outlined provide effective of monitoring of the management thereby enhancing firm’s resistance to financial crisis. In addition, we find that compliance with CSR alone does not explain the financial volatility. Its concert with corporate governance variables is necessary. This result supports stakeholder theory which argues that companies compliant with CSR activities in their business strategy and have larger boards and audit committees, and independent directors on boards and audit committees resist more financial downturns and any economic shock. Furthermore, we find that compliance with Shariah norms plays a significant role in protecting shareholder interests, improving functioning of corporate governance mechanisms and affect positively the resistance of Saudi firms to financial crisis."
New method for processing gamma backscattering spectra to estimate saturation depth and to determine thickness of aluminum and steel materials,"In this study, we present a new gamma spectrum processing method is applied to analyze experimental scattering spectra on aluminum and steel for determining the intensity of the single scattering component. Based on these results, the saturation depth of aluminum and steel materials are 78.8 and 22.5 mm, respectively. The thickness of both materials is determined with a maximum relative deviation of about 7% in comparison with real thickness. Besides, the result also shows that we can use the new spectrum processing method, which is a simple, and useful solution to determine the material thickness, for NaI(Tl) detector and a low activity source."
The upgrading of the cyclic neutron activation analysis facility at the Dalat research reactor,"The cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA) facility based on a pneumatic transfer system for short irradiation and rapid counting has recently been upgraded at the Dalat research reactor. The original facility was only designed for single irradiation. Therefore, this work has aimed to upgrade both hardware and software for the cyclic irradiation. In this paper, the upgrading of the facility for CNAA was described. Irradiation time of the facility were calibrated, thereby reducing irradiation time to seconds with precision. The accuracy and sensitivity of CNAA based-on the upgraded facility were assessed by determination of some short-lived nuclides."
Electro-thermal analysis of an Al–Ti multilayer thin film microheater for MEMS thruster application,A multilayer thin film aluminum/titanium (Al/Ti) microheater is developed for the microthruster liquid propellant vaporizing and gas heating for increasing the specific impulse. The microheater was fabricated onto a Pyrex 7740 substrate using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems processing technology. A finite-element based multiphysics simulation was employed to simulate the microheater performance. The distribution of temperature and variation of the thermal deformation are simulated in modeling with the different input power. And the simulation shows that heat loss of the microheater is relatively low comparing with the normal heater. Subsequently an experimental testing of the microheater performance based on infrared imaging device was actualized with applied voltage from 5 to 36 V. An auger electron spectroscopy detection was employed to validating the assumption that Al layer oxidizing is the main reason of temperature higher in the test than simulation.
Evaluation of the mixing performance in a planar passive micromixer with circular and square mixing chambers,"In this paper, passive planar micromixers based on circular and square mixing chambers spaced at equidistant along the length of micromixer are proposed to operate in the laminar flow regime for high mixing index. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed micromixers by solving the Navier–Stokes equation and convection–diffusion equation. A COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0 is used for computational fluid dynamics. Numerical simulation of mixing of fluids in a micromixer with circular and square chambers in a laminar flow regime has been carried out. Four performance parameters namely, mixing index, pressure drop, pumping power, and performance index are used to evaluate different design configurations of micromixers. Analysis of mixing index based on the standard deviation of the mass fraction is carried with different constriction channel width such as 200, 250, and 300 µm for a range of Reynolds number from 0.1 to 75. The both micromixers show over 95% mixing at the exit for the range 15–75 of Reynolds number at constriction width of 200 µm. Especially, about 99% mixing is achieved at Reynolds number less than one i.e. at 0.1. The effect of Reynolds number on the pressure drop is also investigated. Thus, the proposed micromixers can be used in microfluidic systems which require fast mixing at Re less than 1 and greater than 15."
Effects of Zn-doped on the microstructure and electrical properties of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4(0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) NTC ceramics,"In this paper, the Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) negative temperature coefficient (NTC) ceramics were attained by the traditional solid state reaction method. The effects of Zn addition on microstructure and electrical properties were characterized by thermo-gravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, electrical measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. It was found that the resistivity decreased slightly with increasing Zn ions content for x ≤ 0.2, but increased remarkably for higher Zn ions content. The values ρ25 and B25/50 of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) NTC thermistors were in the range of 126–706 Ω cm and 3323–3714 K, respectively. The values of relative resistance drift (ΔR/R0) were in the range of 2.7–1.13% and had a minimum value with the Zn content x = 0.5 after aging test at 125 °C for 500 h. This suggests that the electrical properties can be adjusted to desired values by controlling the Zn ion doping content. Most importantly, the stability of Mn1.5 − xCo1.2Cu0.3ZnxO4 ceramic can be effectively improved by Zn doping."
Observation of magneto-electric coupling in Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 nanoparticles,"Nanoparticles of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 are synthesized using sol–gel method, their structural, electrical and magnetic properties are systematically investigated. The XRD pattern of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 confirms the orthorhombic perovskite structure with an average crystallite size of 14 nm. The thermal study of as prepared powder indicates that Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 crystallizes at about 1073 K. The electrical study reports an enhanced value of room temperature electrical conductivity equal to 9.15 × 10−3 S cm−1. The change in the magnetic moment for Sr doping and paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition is appreciated in magnetic study. The ferromagnetism is accounted for by the Zener’s double exchange interaction between the Co3+ and Co4+. The occurrence of magneto-electric coupling at T ~ 213 K in the study of nanoparticles of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 is the first experimental finding for this sample. The Sr substituted SmCoO3 becomes ferromagnetic with the values of magnetic anisotropy ~ 35976 (erg/g) and squareness ratio ~ 0.52 at 10 K. AC magnetic susceptibility study confirms the presence of spin glass state."

Altered monetary loss processing and reinforcement-based learning in individuals with obesity,"Individuals with obesity are often characterized by alterations in reward processing. This may affect how new information is used to update stimulus values during reinforcement-based learning. Here, we investigated obesity-related changes in non-food reinforcement processing, their impact on learning performance as well as the neural underpinnings of reinforcement-based learning in obesity. Nineteen individuals with obesity (BMI > = 30 kg/m2, 10 female) and 23 lean control participants (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2, 11 female) performed a probabilistic learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in which they learned to choose between advantageous and disadvantageous choice options in separate monetary gain, loss, and neutral conditions. During learning individuals with obesity made a significantly lower number of correct choices and accumulated a significantly lower overall monetary outcome than lean control participants. FMRI analyses revealed aberrant medial prefrontal cortex responses to monetary losses in individuals with obesity. There were no significant group differences in the regional representation of prediction errors. However, we found evidence for increased functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in individuals with obesity. The present results suggest that obesity is associated with aberrant value representations for monetary losses, alterations in functional connectivity during the processing of learning outcomes, as well as a decresased reinforcement-based learning performance. This may affect how new information is incorporated to adjust dysfunctional behavior and could be a factor contributing to the maintenance of dysfunctional eating behavior in obesity."

Associations between Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype and drug resistance to four first-line drugs: a survey in China,"Investigations on the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China have shown that Beijing genotype strains play a dominant role. To study the association between the M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype and the drug-resistance phenotype, 1286 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates together with epidemiological and clinical information of patients were collected from the center for tuberculosis (TB) prevention and control or TB hospitals in Beijing municipality and nine provinces or autonomous regions in China. Drug resistance testing was conducted on all the isolates to the four first-line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol). A total of 585 strains were found to be resistant to at least one of the four anti-TB drugs. The Beijing family strains consisted of 499 (53.20%) drug-sensitive strains and 439 (46.80%) drug-resistant strains, whereas the non-Beijing family strains comprised 202 (58.05%) drug-sensitive strains and 146 (41.95%) drug-resistant strains. No significant difference was observed in prevalence (χ2= 2.41, P > 0.05) between the drug-resistant and drugsensitive strains among the Beijing family strains. Analysis of monoresistance, multidrug-resistant TB, and geographic distribution of drug resistance did not find any relationships between the M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype and drug-resistance phenotype in China. Results confirmed that the Beijing genotype, the predominant M. tuberculosis genotype in China, was not associated with drug resistance."
Extraction and characterization of anthocyanins from Nitraria tangutorun bobr. dry fruit and evaluation of their stability in aqueous solution and taurine-contained beverage,"This study aimed to extract and identify anthocyanins from Nitraria tangutorun Bobr. dry fruit and evaluate the stability of anthocyanins in aqueous solution and taurine-contained beverage. Extraction at 68 °C for 30 min using 54% ethanol rendered an extract with 386.22 mg/100 g of anthocyanins. Fourteen anthocyanins in N. tangutorun dry fruit were identified using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS, and six of them were found in N. tangutorun dry fruit for the first time. The stability of anthocyanins and changes in color density and antioxidant activity of anthocyanin aqueous solution were evaluated at various pH and temperature levels using an accelerated thermal-stability assay. The degradation of cyanidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)-diglucoside and total anthocyanins and the loss of color density followed first-order model at studied conditions (R2 > 0.91); and the loss of antioxidant activity followed first-order model at 80 and 90 °C (R2 > 0.94). The Ea of cyanidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)-diglucoside and total anthocyanins were higher at pH 3 than that at pH 4 and 5 implying that the degradation of them at a lower pH level was more susceptible to temperature. Although the anthocyanins and color density were markedly loss with increasing the pH and temperature levels, the anthocyanin aqueous solution exhibited remarkable antioxidant capacity. In the beverage with or without taurine, the thermal degradation of cyanidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)-diglucoside and total anthocyanins also followed first-order model (R2 > 0.91), and 300 mg/100 mL of taurine provides protection for the stability of cyanidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)-diglucoside (t1/2=438.61 min) and total anthocyanins (t1/2=391.53 min). N. tangutorun anthocyanins is promising natural food pigments."

A van Leer-Type Numerical Scheme for the Model of a General Fluid Flow in a Nozzle with Variable Cross Section,"A van Leer-type numerical scheme for the model of a general fluid in a nozzle with variable cross section is presented. The model is nonconservative, making it hard for standard numerical schemes. Exact solutions of local Riemann problems are incorporated in the construction of this scheme. The scheme can work well in regions of resonance, where multiple waves are colliding. Numerical tests are conducted, where we compare the errors and orders of accuracy for approximating exact solutions between this scheme and a Godunov-type scheme. Results from numerical tests show that this van Leer-type scheme has a much better accuracy than the Godunov-type scheme."
Envisioning future innovative experimental ecosystems through the foresight approach. Case: Design Factory,"Change makers are visionaries who wish to bring change to their respective fields. As technological change is accelerating, it is relevant to consider, how the way and what we teach can evolve with the future to remain meaningful and pioneering. Design Factory at Aalto University, as an innovative experimental ecosystem with interdisciplinary principles and new teaching methodologies has been successful in and at the forefront in educating the students to be change-makers. The paper presents a case study of holistically anticipating plausible futures for innovative experimental ecosystems utilizing a foresight approach. We analyze how the ways of working, spaces, and teaching methods of one such ecosystem, Design Factory at Aalto University in Finland, could support students learning in the year 20 × 6 {x = 2, 3}. We present the process of drawing virtual lines that connect trends, future drivers, visions, and scenarios using a contemporary approach that fuses qualitative and quantitative methods. The results from the study are six future scenarios for the Design Factory, that have implications for innovation ecosystems in general. These results are expected to further foster or trigger new research and development experiments, directions for building radical environments, new teaching methods and ways of working."
Dental hygienists’ perceptions of professionalism are multidimensional and context-dependent: a qualitative study in Japan,"Due to the declining birth rate and aging of Japanese society, the roles and responsibilities of dental hygienists are continuously expanding. Medical professionalism needs to be pursued continuously throughout one’s career in order to improve dental care and treatment. Although conceptualising professionalism is essential to the education of health professionals, professionalism in the field of dental hygiene has not been defined or adequately examined in Japan. The purposes of this study are to investigate dental hygienists’ perceptions of the constituent elements of professionalism and the factors affecting their perceptions."
Coordinated optimal dispatch and market equilibrium of integrated electric power and natural gas networks with P2G embedded,"As power to gas (P2G) technology gradually matures, the coupling between electricity networks and natural gas networks should ideally evolve synergistically. With the intent of characterizing market behaviors of integrated electric power and natural gas networks (IPGNs) with P2G facilities, this paper establishes a steady-state model of P2G and constructs optimal dispatch models of an electricity network and a natural gas network separately. In addition, a concept of slack energy flow (SEF) is proposed as a tool for coordinated optimal dispatch between the two networks. To study how the market pricing mechanism affects coordinated optimal dispatch in an IPGN, a market equilibrium-solving model for an IPGN is constructed according to game theory, with a solution based on the Nikaido-Isoda function. Case studies are conducted on a joint model that combines the modified IEEE 118-node electricity network and the Belgian 20-node gas network. The results show that if the game between an electric power company and a natural gas company reaches market equilibrium, not only can both companies maximize their profits, but also the coordinated operation of the coupling units, i.e., gas turbines and P2G facilities, will contribute more to renewable energy utilization and carbon emission reduction."
Preparation and Characterization of Chitosan-Coated Diatomaceous Earth for Hexavalent Chromium Removal,"A novel chitosan coated diatomaceous earth (CDE) beads were prepared by the drop-wise method and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and zeta potential. Prepared CDE beads were used for Cr(VI) adsorption from aqueous systems. The effect of several factors including solution-pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration, temperature, and contact time on adsorption process was examined. The adsorption results revealed that the Cr(VI) adsorption was fitting well the Langmuir model indicating a homogeneous adsorption surface for Cr(VI) on the CDE beads. The kinetics of adsorption suggested a pseudo-second-order model fitting better than the pseudo-first-order model. The maximum Cr(VI) adsorption capacity onto prepared CDE beads was 84.23 mg/g. In competition adsorption, the affinity of CDE beads toward mixed metal ions was high for Cr(VI) followed by Pb(II) and it was low for Zn(II) and Ni(II). Loaded CDE beads with Cr(VI) were successfully regenerated by NaOH and reused up to five cycles. The overall results emphasize that the CDE beads could be used as an economically applicable and sustainable adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solutions."
Both inflammatory and regulatory cytokine responses to malaria are blunted with increasing age in highly exposed children,"Young children are at greatest risk for malaria-associated morbidity and mortality. The immune response of young children differs in fundamental ways from that of adults, and these differences likely contribute to the increased susceptibility of children to severe malaria and to their delayed development of immunity. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the peripheral blood during acute infection contribute to the control of parasitaemia, but are also responsible for much of the immunopathology seen during symptomatic disease. Clinical immunity to malaria may depend upon the ability to regulate these pro-inflammatory responses, possibly through mechanisms of immunologic tolerance. In order to explore the effect of age on the immune response to malaria and the development of clinical immunity, cytokines and chemokines were measured in the plasma of children at day 0 of an acute malaria episode and during convalescence."
"Unexpected high circulation of Plasmodium vivax in asymptomatic children from Kédougou, southeastern Senegal","Malaria in Senegal is due essentially to infections by Plasmodium falciparum and, to a lesser extent to Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. By the use of molecular methods, detection of Plasmodium vivax has been recently reported in the region of Kedougou, raising the question of appraisal of its potential prevalence in this setting."
"N, P-dual doped carbon with trace Co and rich edge sites as highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction","Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is key to fuel cells and metal-air batteries which are considered as the alternative clean energy. Various carbon materials have been widely researched as ORR electrocatalysts. It has been accepted that heteroatom doping and exposure of the edge sites can effectively improve the activity of carbon materials. In this work, we used a simple method to prepare a novel N, P-dual doped carbon-based catalyst with many holes on the surface. In addition, trace level Co doping in the carbon material forming Co–N–C active species can further enhance the ORR performance. On one hand, the doping can adjust the electronic structure of carbon atoms, which would induce more active sites for ORR. And on the other hand, the holes formed on the surface of carbon nanosheets would expose more edge sites and can improve the intrinsic activity of carbon. Due to the heteroatom doping and the exposed edge sites, the prepared carbon materials showed highly excellent ORR performance, close to that of commercial Pt/C."
Management of Whiplash Associated Disorders in Australian general practice,"Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) are common and costly, and are usually managed initially by general practitioners (GPs). How GPs manage WAD is largely unstudied, though there are clinical guidelines. Our aim was to ascertain the rate of management (percentage of encounters) of WAD among patients attending Australian general practice, and to review management of these problems, including imaging, medications and other treatments."
How to avoid unintended valgus alignment in distal femoral derotational osteotomy for treatment of femoral torsional malalignment - a concept study,"Defining the optimal cutting plane for derotational osteotomy at the distal femur for correction of torsion in cases of patellofemoral instability is still challenging. This preliminary study investigates changes of frontal alignment by a simplified trigonometrical model and demonstrates a surgical guidance technique with the use of femur cadavers. The hypothesis was that regardless of midshaft bowing, a cutting plane perpendicular to the virtual anatomic shaft axis avoids unintended valgus malalignment due to derotation."
Outcomes of arthroscopic debridement of isolated Ligamentum Teres tears using the iHOT-33,"Tears of the Ligamentum Teres are a common cause of groin pain. Tears of the ligament frequently co-exist alongside other bony or labral intra-articular hip lesions, which are also treated at the time of arthroscopy. For this reason, it is often difficult to assess the effect that debridement alone has on improving patient pain and function. This study aims to assess the short-term outcomes of arthroscopic debridement of isolated Ligamentum Teres tears using a validated patient-reported outcome score – the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33)."
Screw migration and oesophageal perforation after surgery for osteosarcoma of the cervical spine,"Even though internal fixation has expanded the indications for cervical spine surgery, it carries the risks of fracture or migration, with associated potential life threatening complications. Removal of metal work from the cervical spine is required in case of failure of internal fixation, but it can become challenging, especially when a great amount of scar tissue is present because of previous surgery and radiotherapy."
Prevalence of dental caries and associated factors among 12 years old students in Eritrea,"Dental caries is one of the most prevalent diseases of childhood in developing countries. However, there is a paucity of epidemiological data on the prevalence and associated factors of dental caries in Eritrea. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of dental caries among 12 years old school children in Eritrea."
Creating research and development awareness among dental care professionals by use of strategic communication: a 12-year intervention study,"Despite the availability of contemporary research advances, only a limited fraction is implemented into dental practice. One possible way to facilitate this process is to stimulate the research and development (R&D) awareness and interest with aid of strategic communication."
Thermal modeling of a novel rotary engine,"Studies on rotary engines and their high operation efficiency, in comparison with reciprocating-piston engines, has encouraged further research on different types of these engines. This paper focuses on thermal analysis of a novel rotary engine with 24 combustion processes per rotation. This engine has only two moving parts, the vanes and the rotor. Two cams operate as stationary parts. The modeling, based on maximum power and full load operation, evaluates approximately the thermal behavior of the engine running with diesel fuel and a compression ratio (20:1). Initially, by presenting a thermodynamic model, pressure, temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient of combustion gases inside one cylinder of the engine are calculated; results obtained from the model are used as boundary conditions for adjacent control volumes and thereafter steady-state temperature distribution in the engine components are obtained using the commercial software Ansys. With regard to material limitation, the resulting temperature distribution shows that the cam needs an auxiliary cooling system, while the rotor and the vanes cool down using the lubrication oil of the engine. Finally, it is suggested that cooling such as air or water is needed for the cooling of the cam, as an auxiliary cooling system."
Biomass production and salinity response in plants: role of MicroRNAs,"Small non-coding RNAs are one of the major contributors for diverse cellular functions in plants. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one such class of small non-coding RNAs playing crucial role in normal plant growth and development as well as under environmental stresses. miRNA modulates the transcripts level by directly binding to the transcript generated from the target gene and mediate either the cleavage of the target mRNA transcript or the inhibitition of translation of the target transcript or inhibition of target gene expression through epigenetic modification. In the current scenario, understanding the link between the diverse miRNAs and their orchestrated functioning for regulation of stress signaling as well as biomass production is a major challenge. In the present review, we have explored the current knowledge about the plant miRNA families and their functional aspects, particularly in the context of salinity stress tolerance and higher biomass production. We conclude that miRNA families such as miR156, 159, 164, 166, 319, 393, 396 and 414 are possibly mediating the cross talk between biomass production and salinity stress response. The present review may improve the current knowledge about the plant miRNAs and thus may help in generating crop plants for marginal lands."
Nu-DESC DK: the Danish version of the nursing delirium screening scale (nu-DESC),"Delirium is one of the most common complications among elderly hospitalized patients, postoperative patients and patients on intensive care units with a prevalence between 11 and 80%. Delirium is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Reliable instruments are required to detect delirium at an early time point. The Nursing-Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) is a screening tool with high sensitivity and good specificity. However, there is currently no official translation after ISPOR guidelines of any Danish delirium assessment tools available. Thereby hampering the implementation of 2017 ESA-Guidelines on postoperative Delirium in the clinical routine. The aim of this study is to provide an official translation and evaluation of the Nu-DESC into Danish following the ISPOR process."
Improving equity in health care financing in China during the progression towards Universal Health Coverage,China is reforming the way it finances health care as it moves towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) after the failure of market-oriented mechanisms for health care. Improving financing equity is a major policy goal of health care system during the progression towards universal coverage.
Patient experiences of engagement with care plans and healthcare professionals’ perceptions of that engagement,"Although patient engagement is internationally recognized as a core quality indicator of healthcare systems, no report has yet explored patient engagement in Saudi Arabia. Thus, we explored patients’ experiences of engagement with healthcare services and assessed physicians’ and nurses’ perceptions of this engagement."
Oil-soluble ionic liquids as antiwear and extreme pressure additives in poly-α-olefin for steel/steel contacts,"To enhance the lubricating and extreme pressure (EP) performance of base oils, two types of oil-soluble ionic liquids (ILs) with similar anion albeit dissimilar cations were synthesized. The physical properties of the prepared ILs were measured. The anticorrosion properties of ILs were assessed by conducting corrosion tests on steel discs and copper strips, which revealed the remarkable anticorrosion properties of the ILs in comparison with those of the commercial additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). The tribological properties of the two ILs as additives for poly-α-olefin-10 (PAO10) with various mass concentrations were investigated. The tribological test results indicate that these ILs as additives are capable of reducing friction and wear of sliding contacts remarkably as well as enhance the EP performance of blank PAO10. Under similar test conditions, these IL additives exhibit higher lubricating and anti-wear (AW) performances than those of ZDDP based additive package in PAO10. Subsequently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were conducted to study the lubricating mechanism of the two ILs. The results indicate that the formation of tribochemical film plays the most crucial role in enhancing the lubricating and AW behavior of the mixture lubricants."
Upregulation of citrullination pathway: From Autoimmune to Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis,"Increased protein citrullination and peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs), which catalyze the citrullination process, are central in Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and probably involved in the initial steps towards autoimmunity. Approximately, 10% of RA patients develop clinically significantly ILD. A possible shared role of protein citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis remains unclear."
Implications of Third Parties for Contract Design,"We analyze the implications of plausible third-party challenges to the legitimacy of a transaction for contract design. To the extent that such challenges impose reputation and transaction costs, the scrutinized agent has an incentive to choose contractual procedures that make challenges less likely to succeed at court, thereby discouraging the filing of challenges in the first place. The added contractual proceduralization, in turn, create adaptation costs for both the agent and the contractor which are externalized to the principals, making the transaction allegedly inefficient. This setup is of particular relevance in public procurement, where interested third parties—political opponents, excluded bidders, and watchdogs—are always present due to the nature of the transaction."
D-AHP method with different credibility of information,"Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) has attracted wide interest due to its extensive applications in practice. In our previous study, a method called D-AHP (AHP method extended by D numbers preference relation) was proposed to study the MCDM problems based on a D numbers extended fuzzy preference relation, and a solution for the D-AHP method has been given to obtain the weights and ranking of alternatives from the decision data, in which the results obtained by using the D-AHP method are influenced by the credibility of information. However, in previous study the impact of information’s credibility on the results is not sufficiently investigated, which becomes an unsolved issue in the D-AHP. In this paper, we focus on the credibility of information within the D-AHP method and study its impact on the results of a MCDM problem. Information with different credibilities including high, medium and low, respectively, is taken into consideration. The results show that the credibility of information in the D-AHP method slightly impacts the ranking of alternatives, but the priority weights of alternatives are influenced in a relatively obvious extent."
Casimir Effect and Black Hole Radiation,"The gravitational field of a black hole intrinsically creates a potential barrier consisted of two reflecting boundaries; the first one far from the hole and the second one in the vicinity of its horizon. With respect to this fact and assuming the boundaries as good conductors (in view of an observer near the horizon just outside the second boundary), in a series of papers, R.M. Nugayev by considering a conformally coupled massless scalar field and based on the calculations of Candelas and Deutsch (the accelerated-mirror results) has claimed that “...the existence of the potential barrier is as crucial for Hawking evaporation as the existence of the horizon”. In this paper, by taking the same assumptions, through straightforward reasonings, we explicitly show that contrary to this claim, the effects of the first boundary on the black hole radiation are quite negligible. Moreover, the inclusion of the second boundary makes the situation more complicated, because the induced Casimir energy-momentum tensor by this boundary in its vicinity is divergent of order \(\delta ^{-4}\) (δ is the distance to the boundary)."
Estimates of the Modeling Error of the \(\alpha \)-Models of Turbulence in Two and Three Space Dimensions,"This report investigates the convergence rate of the weak solutions \(\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }\) of the Leray-\(\alpha \), modified Leray-\(\alpha \), Navier–Stokes-\(\alpha \) and the zeroth ADM turbulence models to a weak solution \(\mathbf{u}\) of the Navier–Stokes equations. It is assumed that this weak solution \(\mathbf{u}\) of the NSE belongs to the space \(L^4(0, T; H^1)\). It is shown that under this regularity condition the error \(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }\) is \(\mathcal {O}(\alpha )\) in the norms \(L^2(0, T; H^1)\) and \(L^{\infty }(0, T; L^2)\), thus improving related known results. It is also shown that the averaged error \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}-\overline{\mathbf{w}^{\alpha }}\) is higher order, \(\mathcal {O}(\alpha ^{1.5})\), in the same norms, therefore the \(\alpha \)-regularizations considered herein approximate better filtered flow structures than the exact (unfiltered) flow velocities."
Delta opioid receptors recycle to the membrane after sorting to the degradation path,"Soon after internalization delta opioid receptors (DOPrs) are committed to the degradation path by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated binding protein. Here we provide evidence that this classical post-endocytic itinerary may be rectified by downstream sorting decisions which allow DOPrs to regain to the membrane after having reached late endosomes (LE). The LE sorting mechanism involved ESCRT accessory protein Alix and the TIP47/Rab9 retrieval complex which supported translocation of the receptor to the TGN, from where it subsequently regained the cell membrane. Preventing DOPrs from completing this itinerary precipitated acute analgesic tolerance to the agonist DPDPE, supporting the relevance of this recycling path in maintaining the analgesic response by this receptor. Taken together, these findings reveal a post-endocytic itinerary where GPCRs that have been sorted for degradation can still recycle to the membrane."
Markov based transition probability geostatistics in groundwater applications: assumptions and limitations,"Markov based transition probability geostatistics (MTPG) for categorical variables, as implemented by the methodological framework introduced by Carle and Fogg (Math Geol 29(7):891–918, 1997) and extended thereafter, have been extensively applied for the three-dimensional (3D) statistical representation of hydrofacies in real-world aquifers, and the conditional simulation of 3D lithologies for groundwater flow and transport simulations. While conceptually simple and easy to implement, conditional simulation using the MTPG approach is not limitation free. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that raises such concerns in the light of theoretical arguments and numerical findings. That said, the purpose of this study is twofold: (1) present a brief and coherent overview of the basic theory, fundamental assumptions, and limitations of the MTPG methodological framework, and (2) assess its capabilities on the basis of a simple two-dimensional test-case, using large ensembles of stochastic realizations. Contrary to real-world 3D aquifers, where the actual geology is unknown, and the quality of the simulations can be assessed solely on the basis of semi-quantitative arguments using properly selected sets of stochastic realizations, test-cases allow for direct quantitative assessments based on the application of statistical measures to large ensembles of synthetic realizations. Our analysis and obtained results show that stochastic modeling of actual geologies using the MTPG approach of Carle and Fogg (1997), is characterized by simplifying assumptions and theoretical limitations, with the simulated random fields exhibiting statistical structures that strongly depend on the problem under consideration and the modeling assumptions made, leading to increased epistemic uncertainties in the obtained results."
Corporate governance and social norms during financial crisis: evidence from France and Saudi Arabia,"The resistance to financial crisis and compliance with social norms and effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms is considered recently as a good matter of concern. Focusing on differences between French and Saudi firms, we examine the effect of (1) board of directors, (2) audit committee, (3) compliance with Corporate Social Responsibility activities, (4) compliance with Shariah principles on financial volatility during subprime crisis of 2007. We find that larger boards, larger audit committees, independent members on boards and audit committees are related negatively to financial volatility. The result supports corporate governance theory which suggests that corporate governance variables outlined provide effective of monitoring of the management thereby enhancing firm’s resistance to financial crisis. In addition, we find that compliance with CSR alone does not explain the financial volatility. Its concert with corporate governance variables is necessary. This result supports stakeholder theory which argues that companies compliant with CSR activities in their business strategy and have larger boards and audit committees, and independent directors on boards and audit committees resist more financial downturns and any economic shock. Furthermore, we find that compliance with Shariah norms plays a significant role in protecting shareholder interests, improving functioning of corporate governance mechanisms and affect positively the resistance of Saudi firms to financial crisis."
"Descriptive statistics and risk assessment for the control of seasonal pollutant effects of 210Po and 210Pb in coastal waters (Çanakkale, Turkey)","210Po is absorbed into the human body by seafood intake. Especially, mollusks and mussels are known to have much higher 210Po concentration than fish among various other types of seafood and are consumed in large quantities in Aegean Sea. 210Po and 210Pb radionuclide concentrations are obtained in the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and in the sediment samples collected from the Çanakkale. The activity concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb are counted using alpha spectrometry. Activity concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb in mussels are in the ranged of 227 ± 11–540 ± 38 and 17 ± 4–48 ± 5 Bq kg−1 dw (dry weight), for sediments the ranges are 23 ± 6–41 ± 3 and 15 ± 3–44 ± 1 Bq kg−1 dw, respectively. Additionally, annual committed effective dose are calculated due to consumption mussel in Çanakkale coastal region. The highest effective doses of 210Po and 210Po are found as 3187 and 56 μSv, respectively. Finally, risk analysis assessment is recommended to determine the pollutant effects of radionuclides. The risk fractions at the concentrations are easily determined with this evaluation process. This methodology has made a great contribution to risk assessments."
New method for processing gamma backscattering spectra to estimate saturation depth and to determine thickness of aluminum and steel materials,"In this study, we present a new gamma spectrum processing method is applied to analyze experimental scattering spectra on aluminum and steel for determining the intensity of the single scattering component. Based on these results, the saturation depth of aluminum and steel materials are 78.8 and 22.5 mm, respectively. The thickness of both materials is determined with a maximum relative deviation of about 7% in comparison with real thickness. Besides, the result also shows that we can use the new spectrum processing method, which is a simple, and useful solution to determine the material thickness, for NaI(Tl) detector and a low activity source."
The upgrading of the cyclic neutron activation analysis facility at the Dalat research reactor,"The cyclic neutron activation analysis (CNAA) facility based on a pneumatic transfer system for short irradiation and rapid counting has recently been upgraded at the Dalat research reactor. The original facility was only designed for single irradiation. Therefore, this work has aimed to upgrade both hardware and software for the cyclic irradiation. In this paper, the upgrading of the facility for CNAA was described. Irradiation time of the facility were calibrated, thereby reducing irradiation time to seconds with precision. The accuracy and sensitivity of CNAA based-on the upgraded facility were assessed by determination of some short-lived nuclides."
Research on fault diagnosis system of hall for workshop of meta-synthetic engineering based on information fusion,"By analyzing multi-sensor information fusion system and hall for workshop of meta-synthetic engineering (HWME) essentially, a universal information fusion system of HWME based on multi-sensor is put forward. Analyzing the fault diagnosis framework of complex system based on information fusion technique, together with the research on the general process of information fusion synthesis fault diagnosis, a fault diagnosis system framework of HWME based on information fusion is set up, which is all-purposed and runs through the whole process of synthetic fault diagnosis. By this method, a new approach to multi-sensor information fusion synthesis fault diagnosis has been found."
Cerebrovascular and amyloid pathology in predementia stages: the relationship with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline,"Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and amyloid-β (Aβ) often coexist, but their influence on neurodegeneration and cognition in predementia stages remains unclear. We investigated the association between CVD and Aβ on neurodegenerative markers and cognition in patients without dementia."
Pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient treated with dasatinib: a case report,"There have been several reports on dasatinib-induced reversible pulmonary hypertension. This is the first reported case in Latvia; the patient did not discontinue the drug after the first adverse effects in the form of pleural effusions, which we speculate led only to partial reversion of the disease."
Visualising urban energy use: the use of LiDAR and remote sensing data in urban energy planning,"This paper explores the potential for using remotely sensed data from a combination of commercial and open-sources, to improve the functionality, accuracy of energy-use calculations and visualisation of carbon emissions. We present a study demonstrating the use of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and aerial imagery for a mixed-use inner urban area within the North East of England and how this can improve the quality of input data for modelling standardised energy uses and carbon emissions. We explore the scope of possible input data for both (1) building geometry and (2) building physics models from these sources."
Zonal based approach for clustering in heterogeneous WSN,"Huge attention of the researchers is drawn by the wireless sensor network (WSN) due to its applicability in variety of applications. WSN has tiny size low powered device called sensors with an objective to monitor the area of interest. In many applications of WSN, it is impossible to modify the topology or to replace the battery based power supply of the sensor nodes. Hence elongation of network lifetime is required to meet the objective of setting up the network. In this paper, a zonal based clustering technique is proposed wherein the field is divided into zones. The selection of cluster head is dynamic so as to balance the load with even dissipation of power by the deployed Sensor Node. The proposed work is compared with DEEC, SEP, Z-SEP and LEACH protocol and simulation validates the protocol with elongated stability region and extended life time with more successful packet delivery to base station."
On weighted generalized fractional and Hardy-type operators acting between Morrey-type spaces,"We study weighted generalized Hardy and fractional operators acting from generalized Morrey spaces Lp,φ,(ℝn) into Orlicz-Morrey spaces LΦ,φ,(ℝn). We deal with radial quasi-monotone weights and assumptions imposed on weights are given in terms of Zigmund-type integral conditions. We find conditions on φ,Φ, the weight w and the kernel of the fractional operator, which insures such a boundedness. We prove some pointwise estimates for weighted generalized fractional operators via generalized Hardy operators, which allow to obtain the weighted boundedness for fractional operators from those for Hardy operators. We provide also some easy to check numerical inequalities to verify the obtained conditions."
Three-dimensional structures of Mn doped CoP on flexible carbon cloth for effective oxygen evolution reaction,"The development of electrocatalysts with high activity and low cost has attracted growing attentions in recent years. Herein, we reported the Mn-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on flexible activated carbon cloth (Mn–CoP/CC) for the effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low overpotential and high current density. Due to the novel 3D nanostructures of the carbon cloth and doping effect of the Mn element, the Mn doped CoP/CC electrode delivered the best overpotential of 317 mV for water splitting with the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a Tafel slope of ∼65.1 mV/dec, and excellent stability over 16 h in 1.0 mol/L KOH, which is superior or comparable to the most of the reported cobalt-based catalysts. Thus outstanding electrocatalytic performance originates from the Mn doping effect, which resulted in increased surface area and fast charge-transfer. It is believed that these findings would help us to develop high effective and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting."
Can the polyculture with South American catfish improve the feeding efficiency of rainbow trout culture?,"The objective of this study was to determine if the South American catfish (Rhamdia quelen) is suitable to be farmed in polyculture with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in intensive systems during the juvenile phase to maximize feed efficiency. Juveniles of rainbow trout (3.94 ± 0.11 g) and South American catfish (2.07 ± 0.04 g) were distributed in 16 tanks (100 L) with continuous water renewal at the density of 50 fish/tank. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments (proportions between species) and four replicates. The treatments were 100% trout (100T), 70% trout and 30% catfish (70T30C), 50% trout and 50% catfish (50T50C), and 100% catfish (100C). Fish were fed twice daily with pelleted commercial feed (45% crude protein) during an experimental period of 56 days. No feed was provided for the catfish in polyculture. The weight gained by the trout was higher in polyculture. Fish survival did not differ among the treatments. The average survival of the trout in all tanks was 99.6 ± 1.0%, while the survival of the South American catfish was 97.9 ± 2.7%. The total feed conversion ratio was lower in the 70T30J treatment, followed by the 100T treatment. Rainbow trout and South American catfish are compatible species for farming together in the first phase of their juvenile development. The different spaces occupied by these species inside tanks probably prevent competition or agonistic behavior. Catfish eat the non-ingested leftover diet from the trout, which improves feed conversion and increases sustainability."
"Recent seismicity patterns and microearthquake activity on an active intraplate fault system at Koyna-Warna, western India","Recent seismic activity of the Koyna region, western India is reported in this article. The Koyna region is considered to be one of the premier sites of reservoir triggered seismicity worldwide and it has been quite active since the initial impoundment of Shivaji Sagar Lake, north of Koyna Dam, during 1962 and nearby Warna Reservoir in 1985. Recently, a borehole seismic network consisting of 6 seismometers is deployed below the Deccan Traps to monitor the earthquakes in the study region, which recorded a large number of microearthquakes. A dense network of 23 surface broadband seismometers was also operative during the study period. A total of 2478 earthquakes of ML -0.8 to 3.7 recorded by the borehole seismic network, occurred during January 2016 to May 2017. Seismicity patterns in the recent time, which includes a few new zones of intense seismicity clusters in the vicinity of the borehole locations, are identified. Reservoir water levels are found to be strongly associated with the seismicity patterns. The seismicity is mostly concentrated in the vicinity of the Donachiwada fault and Warna during January–May, whereas it spreads during June–December. ‘b’ values have been estimated and found to be varying from 0.74 to 0.93. Seismicity continues to be present in the identified block where the pilot borehole has been drilled."
Three dimensional velocity structure of the Koyna-Warna region using local earthquake tomography,"A dense seismic network (∼100 stations) was operated in the Koyna-Warna region from January 2010 to May 2010, that allow us to collect 400 high-quality local earthquake data of magnitude less than 4. In this region, the fault structure and tectonic setting that accommodate the induced seismicity is not well understood. To investigate the seismotectonics of the region, we have inverted 7826 P- and 7047 S-P arrival times for 3-D Vp and Vp/Vs tomographic models along with hypocenters parameters in the region. Although, Dixit et al. (2014) have performed 3-D local earthquake tomography with double-difference tomography code using catalog differential time data. In this paper, Simulps14 code on the same data set is applied. For better approach P arrival time and S-P travel times are inverted directly for Vp, Vp/Vs variations and earthquake locations. High Vp ∼5.9 to 6.5 and low to high Vp/Vs ∼1.69-1.74 imaged in the hypocenter region. These features interpreted as a fluid bearing rock mass under high pore pressure. It is also observed that below the trap basement form a local topography depression between the Koyna and Warna Reservoirs. To the South of the Warna reservoir, intense seismic activity defines a major cluster of ∼ 5 km width at 3 to7 km deep, located under the trap, where the basement is deepening. Such regions are inferred to be associated with the seismically active faults zones. The obtain velocity anomalies are reliable down to a depth of 10 km. This is also confirmed by the analysis of three resolution parameters viz. Hit count, Derivative Weight sum (DWS) and Resolution Diagonal Elements (RDE)."
Long-term hydrochemical earthquake precursor studies at the Koyna-Warna reservoir site in western India,"Koyna-Warna region of western India is an active seismic zone due to the Reservoir Triggered Seismicity (RTS). Earthquake precursor studies are carried out monitoring hydrochemical and stable isotope signatures in the groundwater from 15 bore wells since January 2005, for more than 12 years (January 2005 to February 2017). Depth of these boreholes ranges from 100 to 250 m. Cyclic or temporal variation in hydrochemistry is observed in few sensitive wells in Koyna region. The Govare well in Koyna is found to be most sensitive and the observed hydrochemical cycle is closely associated with local earthquakes of M > 5. The earthquakes M <5 occurring either in Warna cluster or close to the observation wells, did not generate hydrochemical precursory changes. The increase in hydrochemistry is hypothesized as mixing of two aquifer waters with different hydrochemistry. It is noted that a precursory hydrochemical cycle is observed during first quarter of 2015, but no earthquake M > 5.0 occurred till date. The cyclic changes in hydrochemistry, however, indicate on-going earthquake processes and an impending earthquake of M > 5 in the region."
In-situ pore pressure variations in Koyna-Warna — A promising key to understand triggered earthquakes,"The filling of the Koyna reservoir in western India and the associated triggered earthquakes have been well documented. Several studies have suggested that earthquakes are triggered on pre-existing faults in the region due to changes in pore pressure caused by pore pressure diffusion. To study in-situ pore pressure variations twenty-one borewells were drilled in the Koyna-Warna region under an Indo-German research program during 1995–1998. In most of these wells tidal signals are observed in well level variations indicating sensitivity to small strain changes in hydraulically connected, confined aquifers. Those signals, hence, are suitable to reflect variations in the stress field of local rock formations. More than a decade of well level monitoring has shown four types of earthquake related changes. The pre- and post-earthquake changes are mostly interpretative in nature and difficult to substantiate. The co-seismic and transient changes which are observed for local and large teleseismic events are well established. Wells connected to unconfined aquifers also showed changes related to seismicity in case of large magnitude earthquakes at closer distances. Some anomalous water level fluctuations are seen which are not associated with local or teleseismic earthquakes. These changes are coherent in nature and reflect aseismic regional volume strain."
"Tectonic geomorphology in parts of Koyna region, Maharashtra","Geomorphic signatures in parts of Koyna region were analysed using satellite images and morphometric indices (stream length gradient index and valley width to height ratio) with limited field checks in key areas for understanding the role of tectonics in this seismically active zone. The Koyna River zone, particularly downstream of Koyna dam wall up to Kajali Nadi, is characterised by incised narrow valleys, steep escarpments and structurally controlled drainage. Presence of knick points at consistent elevations between 825 m to 675 m, steep gradients in an otherwise gradual longitudinal profile and valley width to height ratio less than 1.0 suggest readjustment of the streams along NW-SE and N-S directions. The escarpment slopes in general have en echelon arcuate ridge pattern ∼ N45°-N 225° in the western part, and then becomes ∼N 10°- N 190° near Donachiwadi, almost orthogonal to the E-W Koyna River. The Donachiwadi fault runs parallel to the escarpment slopes observed near Kodoli. The fluvial system in Koyna thus indicates rejuvenation controlled by basement propagated structures."
"The subsurface megascopic characteristics of basalt and basement rocks from Koyna-Warna area of Maharashtra, India",Vertical deep boreholes of depth up to 1522.50m have been drilled in Koyna-Warna area of Maharashtra State within the Deccan Volcanic Province to study the most outstanding example of Reservoir Triggered Seismicity (RTS). The drilling of 9 bore-holes in the area has provided a window to earth scientists to peep into geological details available below Deccan Trap.
"Evidence for Neoarchean basement for the Deccan Volcanic flows around Koyna-Warna region, western India: Zircon U-Pb age and Hf-isotopic results","Deep boreholes around the Koyna-Warna seismic zone in the southwestern part of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) enable a rare access to the basement beneath the thick (typically 1-2 km) lava pile, the nature of which has been enigmatic for long. Utilizing the drill core from borehole KBH-1 near Rasati village, we present here in situ Laser Ablation — Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) and LA-MC (multi collector)-ICPMS zircon U-Pb age and Hf-isotopic composition for two samples along with a brief description of the petrology and geochemistry of the representative lithounits of the basement section. The KBH-1 basement section comprises predominantly grey migmatite gneisses of granodiorite, tonalite and quartz monzodiorite composition apart from minor pink monzogranite. The grey gneisses show geochemical affinity to Neoarchean Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) suites and modern calc-alkalic granitoids. Zircons from a granodiorite and a monzogranite samples yield consistent U-Pb ages of 2710±63 Ma and 2700±49 Ma (2σ errors). The initial 176Hf/177Hf values lie in a narrow range (0.281162 to 0.281283) corresponding to εHf(T) values of +3.7 to +8.0 indicating that the magmatic precursors of the KBH-1 gneisses represent juvenile magmatism around 2700 Ma. In terms of the composition and age, a correlation between the gneisses in the KBH-1 borehole and the Neoarchean basement gneisses of the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) is emphasized arguing for the extension of the EDC to the Koyna-Warna region."
Risk Factors for Incisional Hernia in Children,"Incisional hernia (IH) is a major complication of abdominal surgery. Although previous studies reported that the incidence of IH after abdominal surgery in adults was 5–50% and that various independent risk factors were involved, IH in children is still not well known. The objective of our study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for IH in children."
Treatment Outcomes and Prognostic Factors After Recurrence of Esophageal Squamous Cell carcinoma,The evaluation of treatment outcomes and detection of prognostic factors after recurrence are very important for tailoring optimal therapies for individual patients with recurrent esophageal cancer.
Learning spatially correlation filters based on convolutional features via PSO algorithm and two combined color spaces for visual tracking,"Last years, we have seen an emergence of wide methods in visual object tracking topic as convolutional neural network combined with correlation filter such as hierarchical features (HCF) (Ma et al. 20). However, upon the fact that some features may cause the tracking failures, the existing methods are still suffering of handling complex object appearance changes such as fast motion, significant deformation and occlusions. Further, they learn the correlation filter in frequency domain using Fourier transform, which cause unwanted boundary effects, which severely degrade the quality of the tracking model. Moreover, these methods are incapable of dealing with the illumination variation because they rely only on RGB base for color sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which addresses the pre-cited problems. As first contribution, we learn adaptively three correlation filters in the spatial domain, with hierarchical convolutional features extracted from specific layers. Indeed, we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to solve the update model equation of the correlation filters. Second, we propose that the switching between RGB and HSV color bases, give a soft manner to handle the illumination variation. For this aim, an HSV-energy condition is presented to choose the appropriate color base resorting to the energy of the second HSV component. Extensive experiments on a common benchmark dataset, justify that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art methods."
Pretreatment of Sugarcane Bagasse from Cane Hybrids: Effects on Chemical Composition and 2G Sugars Recovery,"Cell wall composition in lignocellulosic biomass varies depending on genetic origin, growth conditions, weather and soil conditions. Here, we have evaluated the chemical characterization, morphology and enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies (after sequential dilute acid-base pretreatment) of sugarcane bagasse from five different hybrid varieties of sugarcane. On average, bagasse samples showed cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and ash compositions of 40.84, 24.07, 33.71 and 0.68%, respectively. Sequential acid-base pretreatment removed approximately 77 and 58% hemicellulose and lignin, respectively, leaving pulp samples rich in cellulose (up to 80%), which exhibited a maximum saccharification yields of 55.39% after enzymatic hydrolysis. We found average contents of cellulose (54.17 and 77.48%), hemicellulose (5.64 and 6.07%), lignin (37.28 and 15.40%) and ash (0.54 and 0.32%) in cellulignin and cellulosic pulp, respectively. Results showed that the genetic variability of sugarcane had no influence on the chemical composition and sugar recovery after saccharification of bagasse samples. Therefore, sugarcane bagasse from these new sugarcane varieties samples may be used for second generation sugars production. Cellulosic sugars may serve as primary building block for renewable fuels and chemicals production at commercial scale under biorefinery concept."
A Novel Group-Fused Sparse Partial Correlation Method for Simultaneous Estimation of Functional Networks in Group Comparison Studies,"The conventional way to estimate functional networks is primarily based on Pearson correlation along with classic Fisher Z test. In general, networks are usually calculated at the individual-level and subsequently aggregated to obtain group-level networks. However, such estimated networks are inevitably affected by the inherent large inter-subject variability. A joint graphical model with Stability Selection (JGMSS) method was recently shown to effectively reduce inter-subject variability, mainly caused by confounding variations, by simultaneously estimating individual-level networks from a group. However, its benefits might be compromised when two groups are being compared, given that JGMSS is blinded to other groups when it is applied to estimate networks from a given group. We propose a novel method for robustly estimating networks from two groups by using group-fused multiple graphical-lasso combined with stability selection, named GMGLASS. Specifically, by simultaneously estimating similar within-group networks and between-group difference, it is possible to address inter-subject variability of estimated individual networks inherently related with existing methods such as Fisher Z test, and issues related to JGMSS ignoring between-group information in group comparisons. To evaluate the performance of GMGLASS in terms of a few key network metrics, as well as to compare with JGMSS and Fisher Z test, they are applied to both simulated and in vivo data. As a method aiming for group comparison studies, our study involves two groups for each case, i.e., normal control and patient groups; for in vivo data, we focus on a group of patients with right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy."
Anticancer activity of Schiff base–Poloxamer P85 combination against kidney cancer,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 80% of the primary renal cancers, and current treatment strategies are not sufficient to provide a certain solution. Since there are not many treatment options, interest in discovery of alternative drugs has increased."
Integration of OMNI channels and machine learning with smart technologies,"Fast evolution of the Internet, mobile technologies and energy efficient communication protocols has given a new momentum to e-businesses and world become a global village. Due to increase in the usage of internet and number of mobile users, many companies use these channels to make their products and brands visible to their customers all over the world. Although, some progress has been made towards this direction but further exploration is required, particularly it is still a challenge to enhance in-flight passengers’ shopping experience through efficient and reliable communication protocols. In this paper, we proposed a framework for omni-channel which is based on cognitive radio and machine learning. The proposed cognitive radio communication protocols provide seamless connectivity to in-flight passengers through energy efficient mode like machine learning (ML). Here, machine learning helps to develop user profile, based on relevance feedback that address the problem of catalogue and information overload. In this paper, we also discuss various challenges and opportunities associated with the proposed omni-channel business model. Moreover, the role and impact of emerging technologies such as cognitive radio and 5G in realizing omni-channel businesses is discussed in this paper. Our results explain the seamless communication between aircraft users and merchandise, through reliable and efficient connectivity when the aircraft passes over different geographic areas i.e. urban/rural land or sea at different altitudes and geographic locations. Here, backup data channel is introduced which further enhance the reliability of connection especially when primary users turns ON during the communication. Furthermore, the proposed model helps to reduce communication time and consume less energy to transmit with high throughput as compared to the benchmark cognitive radio protocols."
Energy-efficient secure outsourcing decryption of attribute based encryption for mobile device in cloud computation,"In this paper two new ways for efficient secure outsourcing the decryption of key-policy attribute-based encryption (\(KP-ABE\)) with energy efficiency are proposed. Based on an observation about the permutation property of the access structure for the attribute based encryption schemes, we propose a high efficient way for outsourcing the decryption of KP-ABE, which is suitable for being used in mobile devices. But it can only be used for the ABE schemes having tree-like access structure for the self-enclosed system. The second way is motivated from the fact that almost all the previous work on outsourcing the decryption of \(KP-ABE\) cares little about the ciphertext length. Almost all the previous schemes for secure outsourcing the decryption of ABE have linear length ciphertext with the attributes or the policy. But transferring so long ciphertexts via wireless network for mobile phone can easily run out of battery power, therefore it can not be adapted to practical application scenarios. Thus another new scheme for outsourcing the decryption of ABE but with constant-size ciphertexts is proposed. Furthermore, our second proposal gives a new efficient way for secure outsourcing the decryptor’s secret key to the cloud, which need only one modular exponentiation while all the previous schemes need many. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposals and the results show that our proposals are practical."

R132 mutations in canine isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) lead to functional changes,"Glioma is the second most common intracranial neoplasia in dogs, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. In humans, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is frequently mutated in gliomas. Although almost all human IDH1 mutations have been identified as involving the Arg132 codon, few studies have reported structural, functional, and mutational information for canine IDH1. Therefore, in this study, we cloned the canine IDH1 homologue and used PCR mutagenesis to substitute the wildtype (WT) Arg132 with His (R132H) or Ser (R132S). WT and mutated IDH1 were overexpressed in HeLa cells, and their presence was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry using mutation-specific antibodies. The IDH1 activity between WT, R132H, and R132S transfectants was compared by measuring the production of NADH and NADPH. NADPH production in R132H and R132S transfectants was lower than that in WT, but NADH levels were not significantly different. Finally, we detected increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in the R132H and R132S transfectants. These results indicated that the canine IDH1 Arg132 mutation has the potential to induce carcinogenesis in canine somatic cells."
Statistical optimization for enhanced bacoside A production in plant cell cultures of Bacopa monnieri,"The bioactive compound, bacoside A, has immense importance for the treatment of memory disorders and Alzheimer’s disease. Due to the growing commercial interest in the herb, Bacopa monnieri, it has been listed as highly endangered species. The present study was aimed at enhancing the production of bacoside A using an alternative technology of plant cell suspension culture. Initial experiments of docking simulations using bacoside A showed good inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase (binding energy value of − 20 kcal/mol), when comparison was made with other phytocompounds and the synthetic drug for Alzheimer’s disease. In vitro experiments established that B. monnieri cell suspension culture can be developed in Murashige and Skoog medium containing containing 0.1 mg/L benzylaminopurine and 0.5 mg/L naphthalene acetic acid. Plackett–Burman studies predicted that the most effective factors for maximum biomass production were inoculum size (t-value of 4.87), sucrose concentration (t-value of 0.25) and KH2PO4 concentration (t-value of 0.007). The nitrate to ammonium ratio (t-value of − 0.42) did not have significant effect on the cell suspension biomass. The optimum concentration of the crucial variables obtained from a central composite design were—inoculum size of 2 g/L, sucrose concentration of 30 g/L and KH2PO4 concentration of 1.24 mM in one-sixth strength MS medium. The best model for optimum production of biomass and bacoside A was experimentally verified and the correlation between the predicted and actual values was found to be 99% for biomass and 94% for bacoside A production. The experimental results have been discussed in the present work."
"In vitro photoautotrophic acclimatization, direct transplantation and ex vitro adaptation of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)","We investigated the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2)-ambient (350 µmol CO2 mol−1) and CO2-enriched (1500 µmol CO2 mol−1) conditions of in vitro photoautotrophic system on two cultivars, ‘RRIM600’ and ‘RRIT413’ of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) in an acclimatization process of 45 days. Survival percentage of in vitro rubber tree plantlets derived from somatic embryos under ambient CO2 was better than those under CO2-enriched conditions, especially in cv. ‘RRIT413’. Subsequently, the survival rate of ex vitro transplanted plantlets was similar to the in vitro plantlets and abnormal morphological characters such as light-green leaves (SPAD), small leaves in cv. ‘RRIT413’ acclimatized under CO2-enriched conditions were demonstrated 30 days after the plantlets were transferred into the soil. Maximum quantum yield of PSII, photon yield of PSII, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in cv. ‘RRIT413’ acclimatized under CO2-enriched conditions were sharply declined by 39.0, 50.6, 47.1 and 45.8%, respectively as compared to those acclimatized under ambient CO2 conditions. In contrast, the in vitro acclimatized plantlets of cv. ‘RRIM600’ were un-responsive under both ambient- and enriched-CO2 conditions. In conclusion, genotypic dependent in response to CO2 enriched conditions in in-vitro acclimatization of rubber tree plantlets was evidently demonstrated as a key result to regulate plant growth and development in ex vitro environments. Interestingly, soluble sugar contents (sucrose, glucose and fructose) were increased after transplanting the plantlets of cv. ‘RRIM600’ acclimatized under CO2-enriched condition into the soil and thus, can be considered as an adaptive indicator of ex vitro adaptation."
"Changes in nesting success and breeding abundance of Spectacled Eiders Somateria fischeri in the Chaun Delta, Chukotka, Russia, 2003–2016","The Spectacled Eider Somateria fischeri is a rare sea duck confined to breeding in the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta and Arctic coasts of Alaska and Russia. Almost nothing is known about its status and breeding biology in the Russian Arctic. Stratified systematic nest searches were conducted annually of Spectacled Eider nests on Ayopechan Island in the Chaun Delta, Arctic Russia during 2003–2016. Mean nest densities were stable during 2003–2009 but declined by 8.0% per annum during 2009–2016. Mean clutch size and annual female survival did not change over the same period, during which time annual nest survival and hatching success declined significantly. A simple three age-class matrix model estimated annual asymptotic population growth rate (λ) using observed fecundity from the beginning (1.1 hatched chick per female, λ = 0.864) and end (0.45 hatched chick per female, λ = 0.828) of the study period. This confirmed that to stabilize this population required three immigrant recruits for every local recruit at the beginning of the study and nine towards the end. Declines in annual nest survival appear correlated with (i) declines in nesting Sabine’s Gulls Xema sabini and Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea with which nesting Spectacled Eiders associated and may have gained protection from predators, and (ii) marginally significant increases in large gull and mammalian predators at the site. Should current trends in nest density and fecundity continue, the survival of this breeding Spectacled Eider population is in jeopardy."
A new genus and species of cheilostome bryozoan associated with hermit crabs in the subantarctic Southwest Atlantic,"Some bryozoan species occur on gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs, often dominating the shell surface to the exclusion of other encrusters. Symbioses between bryozoans and pagurid crabs are known from a wide latitudinal range, including tropical, warm- and cold-temperate regions. Here we describe Burdwoodipora paguricola gen. et sp. nov., a cheilostome bryozoan associated with pagurized shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus comptus White in subantarctic waters of the Southwest Atlantic. The association seems to be obligate, as the bryozoan was always found enlarging the last whorl of its gastropod substrate. The new species, however, is not species specific with regard to its shell substrate, as it was found to be associated with 31 species of gastropods with helicoidal coiling. Well-developed colonies may project up to 360° from the outer lip of the shell. The chamber built by the bryozoan is usually larger than the whorl that would have been generated by the gastropod. This is one of the few known cases of an obligate association between a bryozoan and a pagurid crab outside the ascophoran family Hippoporidridae and is also the first bryozoan/hermit crab symbiosis documented in the subantarctic region. The inclusion of Burdwoodipora in the Pacificincolidae, a family currently represented by just four species from the Northern Hemisphere, is discussed."
Monoterpene biotransformation by Colletotrichum species,To investigate the biocatalytic potential of Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum nymphaeae for monoterpene biotransformation.
Flash nanoprecipitation of polymer supported Pt colloids with tunable catalytic chromium reduction property,"Pt nanoparticle (NP) embedded polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) colloids (Pt@PS-b-PVP) are prepared through flash nanoprecipitation (FNP). Uniform Pt@PS-b-PVP nanocomposites with ~5 nm Pt NPs decorating the surface on PS-b-PVP nanospheres are easily prepared with tunable size and Pt arrangement. The catalytic chromium reduction property of Pt@PS-b-PVP is tested. The hybrid colloids exhibited excellent catalytic performance as well as tunable ability dependent on the fined-controlled nanostructure. Moreover, the reported nanocomposites are reused for four times without loss of catalytic activity."
Clustering of near duplicate images using bundled features,"Clustering the images is generally based on the image’s visual features. Selection of relevant features is the most essential task. A clustering approach based on the bundled features is presented in this paper. Bundling of affine scale invariant feature transform (ASIFT) feature helps to cluster the near duplicates. When the local features are combined with the ASIFT features, the clustering efficiency is increased. Clustering the results from the web image search engines is very essential to help users narrow their search. We applied our idea of clustering with bundled features over Google Image search results. The results obtained show that the presented approach outperforms compared to the clustering done only with local features."
Research for service flow module granularity design based on fuzzy spaces quotient theory,"In the research of modular design of service flow, this paper proposes a method to partition the service flow module based on fuzzy spaces quotient theory to reduce the subjectivity of module granularity selection. On the basis of service elements identification, the interrelation among service elements is analyzed in detail. And the further evaluation is made from three aspects such as service flow relevance, service source relevance and service function relevance. By working out similarity matrix between service elements and clustering attributes, the integrated fuzzy similarity matrix is obtained. And the service flow module granularity space is educated by cluster service elements through acquiring hierarchical structure using algorithm. Finally by the grey relational analysis theory and the proper index system, the optimal project of service flow module can be obtained. In this paper, the feasibility of the method above is verified by the maintenance service flow and the module granularity design of the excavator walking mechanism."
Hand gesture recognition based on convolution neural network,"Due to the complexity issue of the hand gesture recognition feature extraction, for example the variation of the light and background. In this paper, the convolution neural network is applied to the recognition of gestures, and the characteristics of convolution neural network are used to avoid the feature extraction process, reduce the number of parameters needs to be trained, and finally achieve the purpose of unsupervised learning. Error back propagation algorithm, is loaded into the convolution neural network algorithm, modify the threshold and weights of neural network to reduce the error of the model. In the classifier, the support vector machine that is added to optimize the classification function of the convolution neural network to improve the validity and robustness of the whole model."
Understanding Drinking Game Behaviors: A Consideration of Alcohol Expectancies and Motives to Play and Drink,"Drinking motives have been theorized as “the final common pathway” to alcohol use, and have been found to be associated with certain drinking patterns and related outcomes. Given the importance of the context in which people drink, researchers have also begun to pay close attention to motives that are specific to participation in a drinking game. The present study builds on this burgeoning body of work by testing how sociability and liquid courage alcohol outcome expectancies and valuations are indirectly associated with drinking game behaviors by way of drinking game motives. Participants consisted of 686 students from eight U.S. colleges/universities (ages 18–23, mean age = 19.45; 73.8% female; 68.2% white) who completed a self-report questionnaire which asked about drinking game behaviors and motives for playing, alcohol outcome expectancies and valuations, general drinking motives, and typical alcohol use. Controlling for demographics, general drinking motives, and typical alcohol use, results indicated that liquid courage (alcohol outcome expectancies) and sociability (alcohol outcome expectancies and valuations) were indirectly associated with drinking game behaviors by way of enhancement/thrills and social lubrication motives for playing drinking games, respectively. Findings suggest that motives specific to playing drinking games operate similarly to general drinking motives as the “final common pathway” to drinking game behaviors. Implications for motivation-matched and expectancy challenge strategies aimed at reducing drinking games participation on college campuses are discussed."
Biomonitoring of polychlorinated biphenyls in Bavaria/Germany—long-term observations and standardization,"In the 1980s, it was demonstrated that semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) accumulate in plant leaves. Plants are at the base of the food chain, and therefore a starting point for transfer of PCBs to animals and related human exposure. For two decades, the Environment Agency of the German federal state of Bavaria (LfU) has been operating long-term monitoring stations to measure the impact of organic air pollutants. Standardized ryegrass, curly kale, and spruce needles are used as bioindicators for the atmospheric entries of PCBs into vegetation. From the end of 1990s to 2009, there was a marked decline in the concentrations of indicator PCBs (i-PCBs) and a minor decline in PCB-TEQ levels. After 2009, the concentrations leveled off. In rural areas, the median concentrations of Σ6 i-PCB in ryegrass and curly kale were about 3 and 4 μg/kg dm in 2000, and have been about 0.5 and 1 μg/kg dm since 2009, respectively. Concentrations in spruce needles fell from 0.9 to 0.4 μg/kg dm. Median PCB-TEQ concentrations in the bioindicator plants ranged from 0.05 to 0.23 ng/kg dm between 2002 and 2009 and from 0.15 to 0.05 ng/kg dm after 2009. Indicator PCB and PCB-TEQ concentrations were several times higher at the urban station in Munich than at the rural areas, reflecting the emissions from in-use PCB stocks in the building sector. The likely reason of the slower decrease of PCB-TEQ compared to i-PCBs is the formation of PCB-126 by dechlorination of industrial PCBs in open applications."
Essential oils of Origanum compactum and Thymus vulgaris exert a protective effect against the phytopathogen Allorhizobium vitis,"Allorhizobium (Agrobacterium) vitis is a host-specific pathogenic bacterium that causes grapevine crown gall disease, affecting vine growth and production worldwide. The antibacterial activities of different aromatic plant essential oils were tested in vitro and in planta against A. vitis. Among the essential oils tested, those of Origanum compactum and Thymus vulgaris showed the most significant in vitro antibacterial activities, with a MIC of 0.156 and 0.312 mg/mL, respectively. A synergistic effect of these two essential oils (1:1) was observed and confirmed by the checkerboard test. Carvacrol (61.8%) and thymol (47.8%) are, respectively, the major compounds in the essential oils of O. compactum and T. vulgaris and they have been shown to be largely responsible for the antibacterial activities of their corresponding essential oils. Results obtained in vitro were reinforced by an in planta pathogenicity test. A mixture of O. compactum and T. vulgaris essential oils (1:1), inoculated into the injured stem of a tomato plant and a grapevine at 0.312 mg/mL as a preventive treatment, reduced both the number of plants developing gall symptoms and the size of the tumors."
Efficient removal of Hg2+ in aqueous solution with fishbone charcoal as adsorbent,"The Hg2+ removal performance of fishbone charcoal prepared from discarded fishbone has been investigated in this work. The XRD, FTIR, and BET results demonstrated that the main composition of fishbone charcoal was hydroxyapatite and the specific surface area was 117 m2/g. The adsorption experiments indicated that fishbone charcoal had an extremely high adsorption capacity for Hg2+ (243.77 mg/g). The excellent Hg2+ adsorption capacity might be ascribed to the ion exchange of Hg2+ to the Ca2+ in the structure of fishbone charcoal, complexation of Hg2+ with ≡Ca(OH)2+ on the surface of fishbone charcoal, as well as electrostatic interaction between electronegative fishbone charcoal surface and cation Hg2+. This work transformed kitchen garbage (i.e., fishbone) into an effective mercury adsorbent with considerable capacity, giving a perspective sight for the utilization of solid waste."
Biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Piper betle aqueous extract and evaluation of its anti-quorum sensing and antibiofilm potential against uropathogens with cytotoxic effects: an in vitro and in vivo approach,"Urinary tract infections are the utmost common bacterial infections caused by Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. These uropathogens resist the action of several antibiotics due to their ability to form biofilms. Most of these bacterial pathogens use the quorum sensing (QS) machinery to co-ordinate their cells and regulate several virulence factors and biofilm formation. On the other hand, the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of silver nanoparticles have been well reported against certain bacterial pathogens, but to the best of our knowledge, no report is available against the pathogenicity of uropathogens in particular S. marcescens and P. mirabilis. Therefore, the present study is primarily focused on the anti-QS and antibiofilm potential of Piper betle-based synthesized silver nanoparticles (PbAgNPs) against S. marcescens and P. mirabilis. Initially, the silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the aqueous extract of P. betle and characterized by UV-absorbance spectroscopy, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and DLS. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were assessed for their anti-QS activity and the obtained results revealed that the PbAgNPs inhibited the QS-mediated virulence factors such as prodigiosin, protease, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharides and hydrophobicity productions in uropathogens. The gene expression analysis divulged the downregulation of fimA, fimC, flhD, and bsmB genes in S. marcescens and flhB, flhD, and rsbA genes in P. mirabilis, respectively. The in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans assays revealed the non-toxic and anti-adherence efficiency of PbAgNPs. Furthermore, the non-toxic effect of PbAgNPs was also confirmed through peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal lung epithelial cells. Therefore, the contemporary study demonstrates the use of PbAgNPs as a possible alternative toward conventional antibiotics in controlling QS and biofilm-related uropathogen infections."
Persistent organochlorine pesticides in aquatic environments and fishes in Taiwan and their risk assessment,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are ubiquitous contaminants with high bioaccumulation and persistence in the environment; they can have adverse effects in humans and animals. This study examined residual concentrations in water, sediments, and fishes as well as the association between the health risks of OCPs and fish consumption in the Taiwanese population. Various water and sediment samples from Taiwanese aquaculture and fish samples from different sources were collected and analyzed through gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the concentrations of 20 OCPs, namely, aldrin; cis-chlordane; trans-chlordane; dieldrin; endrin; alpha-endosulfan; beta-endosulfan; heptachlor; hexachlorobenzene; alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane; beta-hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; mirex; pentachlorobenzene; o,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT); p,p′-DDT; and DDT metabolites (o,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [DDD]; p,p’-DDD; o,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE]; and p,p’-DDE). None of the analyzed samples was positive for OCP contamination, suggesting no new input pollution from the land through washing into Taiwanese aquaculture environments. However, OCP residues were detected in fishes caught along the coast, namely, skipjack tuna and bigeye barracuda, and in imported fishes, such as codfish and salmon. DDT was the predominant pesticide. The contamination pattern of persistent organic pollutants was as follows: dieldrin > cis-chlordane > hexachlorobenzene, with average concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 2.74 ng/g. The risk was assessed in terms of the estimated daily intake (EDI) for potential adverse indices; the EDI of OCP residues was lower than 1% of the acceptable daily intake established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization. The assessed risk was negligible and considered to be at a safe level, suggesting no association between fish consumption and risks to human health in Taiwan. However, a continuous monitoring program for OCP residues in fishes is necessary to further assess the possible effects on human health."
Constraint programming and operations research,"We present an overview of the integration of constraint programming (CP) and operations research (OR) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We interpret CP and OR as relying on a common primal-dual solution approach that provides the basis for integration using four main strategies. The first strategy tightly interweaves propagation from CP and relaxation from OR in a single solver. The second applies OR techniques to domain filtering in CP. The third decomposes the problem into a portion solved by CP and a portion solved by OR, using CP-based column generation or logic-based Benders decomposition. The fourth uses relaxed decision diagrams developed for CP propagation to help solve dynamic programming models in OR. The paper cites a significant fraction of the literature on CP/OR integration and concludes with future perspectives."
"A tuff cone erupted under frozen-bed ice (northern Victoria Land, Antarctica): linking glaciovolcanic and cosmogenic nuclide data for ice sheet reconstructions","The remains of a small volcanic centre are preserved on a thin bedrock ridge at Harrow Peaks, northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The outcrop is interpreted as a monogenetic tuff cone relict formed by a hydrovolcanic (phreatomagmatic) eruption of mafic magma at 642 ± 20 ka (by 40Ar-39Ar), corresponding to the peak of the Marine Isotope Stage 16 (MIS16) glacial. Although extensively dissected and strewn with glacial erratics, the outcrop shows no evidence for erosion by ice. From interpretation of the lithofacies and eruptive mechanisms, the weight of the evidence suggests that eruptions took place under a cold-based (frozen-bed) ice sheet. This is the first time that a tuff cone erupted under cold ice has been described. The most distinctive feature of the lithofacies is the dominance of massive lapilli tuff rich in fine ash matrix and abraded lapilli. The lack of stratification is probably due to repeated eruption through a conduit blasted through the ice covering the vent. The ice thickness is uncertain but it might have been as little as 100 m and the preserved tephra accumulated mainly as a crater (or ice conduit) infill. The remainder of the tuff cone edifice was probably deposited supraglacially and underwent destruction by ice advection and, particularly, collapse during a younger interglacial. Dating using 10Be cosmogenic exposure of granitoid basement erratics indicates that the erratics are unrelated to the eruptive period. The 10Be ages suggest that the volcanic outcrop was most recently exposed by ice decay at c. 20.8 ± 0.8 ka (MIS2) and the associated ice was thicker than at 642 ka and probably polythermal rather than cold-based, which is normally assumed for the period."
Judd−Ofelt Parameters via Bayesian Inference,"Bayesian inference was used as a new approach to calculate of rare earth (RE) ion spectroscopic parameters within the Judd−Ofelt theory using the Li2O-B2O3-Al2O3 glass system doped with Nd2O3 and TiO2. This system was synthesized by the fusion method, and the physical properties of the as-synthesized material were investigated. Optical absorption, photoluminescence, micro-Raman, mass density, refractive index, and radiative lifetime calcuations were performed. We investigated the effects of crystal field changes on Nd3+-ions caused due to co-doping with increasing TiO2 content. We observed that co-doping with TiO2 altered the radiative transition rates A(J,J′), favored symmetry enhancement around the Nd3+-ions, and promoted the onset of vibrational modes, contributed to the attenuation of O-H bonds, and substantially increased the spectroscopic quality, χ."
An intact cytokinin-signaling pathway is required for Bacillus sp. LZR216-promoted plant growth and root system architecture altereation in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings,"Wide ranges of microorganisms found in rhizhosphere are able to regulate plant growth and development through production of phytohormones. However, little is known about the effects of these rhizobacteria on phytohormone cytokinin signal transduction in plants. We here found that Bacillus sp. LZR216 can promote growth and alter the root system architecture of Arabidopsis. To study the roles of cytokinin in this process, we used a series of cytokinin signaling mutants. We found that LZR216 inoculation exhibited little effects on the growth promotion and root development of the triple mutant ahp2,3,5. However, LZR216 promoted the growth and altered the root system architecture of single and double mutants of the cytokinin receptor. Furthermore, LZR216 treatment decreased the ARR5-GUS expression in the shoot apical meristem, but increased the expression in root tips. Transcript analysis indicated that LZR216 down-regulates the expressions of AHK3/AHK4, AHP1, and ARR4/5/7/10/12/15 in shoots, but up-regulates the expressions of AHK3/AHK4, AHP1/AHP3, and ARR4/5/7/10/12/15 in roots. Collectively, LZR216 plays different roles in cytokinin signaling between roots and shoots in Arabidopsis, and an intact cytokinin-signaling pathway is necessary for LZR216-promoted plant growth and root system architecture alteration."
Proteomic analysis of positive influence of alternate wetting and moderate soil drying on the process of rice grain filling,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important crops in the world to feed ever increasing world population. An increase in output of rice crop per unit is imminent. Alternate wetting and moderate soil drying (AWD) irrigation technology has been recommended as a good practice method to improve grain filling of rice crop at late growing stages. Physiological, molecular and agronomic parameters were adopted to elucidate the role of rice stem and sheath under AWD treatment as compared to the conventional irrigation during the grain filling stage. AWD treatment significantly increased stem and sheath dry weight, carbohydrate reserves and their remobilization to the grain, especially inferior spikelet grains. The results showed that the transport and conversion rate of the stem and sheath photoassimilates increased by 9.87 and 8.37%, respectively. Furthermore, protein expression profiles of the stem and sheath at 10, 20 and 30 days after flowering were analyzed. We examined 220 differentially expressed proteins, and successfully identified 166 proteins, including 71 proteins in the stem and 95 proteins in the sheath involved in thirteen important functional groups. Our results suggest that the AWD treatment at the rice grain filling stage is highly conducive to trigger the mobilization of the N assimilates from leave and root to the stem and sheath, and then promotes to remobilize the reserves to the grain through coordinately expressed proteins involved in photosynthesis, systematic senescence, oxidative stress defense, signal transduction and other metabolisms. This study reveals the metabolic mechanism of the stem and sheath in response to AWD at grain filling stage, and provides theoretical evidence for better quality control and scientific improvement of rice in practice."
A solvable irrelevant deformation of AdS3/CFT2,"Recently we proposed a universal solvable irrelevant deformation of AdS3/CFT2 duality, which leads in the ultraviolet to a theory with a Hagedorn entropy [1]. In this note we provide a worldsheet description of this theory as a coset CFT, and compare its spectrum to the field theory predictions of [2, 3]."
Learning from Higgs physics at future Higgs factories,"Future Higgs factories can reach impressive precision on Higgs property measurements. In this paper, instead of conventional focus of Higgs precision in certain interaction bases, we explore its sensitivity to new physics models at the electron-positron colliders. In particular, we study two categories of new physics models, Standard Model (SM) with a real scalar singlet extension, and Two Higgs Double Model (2HDM) as examples of weakly-interacting models, Minimal Composite Higgs Model (MCHM) and three typical patterns of the more general operator counting for strong interacting models as examples of strong dynamics. We perform a global fit to various Higgs search channels to obtain the 95% C.L. constraints on the model parameter space. In the SM with a singlet extension, we obtain the limits on the singlet-doublet mixing angle sin θ, as well as the more general Wilson coefficients of the induced higher dimensional operators. In the 2HDM, we analyze tree level effects in tan β vs. cos(β − α) plane, as well as the one-loop contributions from the heavy Higgs bosons in the alignment limit to obtain the constraints on heavy Higgs masses for different types of 2HDM. In strong dynamics models, we obtain lower limits on the strong dynamics scale. In addition, once deviations of Higgs couplings are observed, they can be used to distinguish different models. We also compare the sensitivity of various future Higgs factories, namely Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), Future Circular Collider (FCC)-ee and International Linear Collider (ILC)."
Shear sum rule in higher derivative gravity theories,"We study holographic shear sum rules in Einstein gravity with curvature squared corrections. Sum rules relate weighted integral over spectral densities of retarded correlators in the shear channel to the one point functions of the CFTs. The proportionality constant can be written in terms of the data of three point functions of the stress tensors of the CFT (t2 and t4). For CFTs dual to two derivative Einstein gravity, this proportionality constant is just \( \frac{d}{2\left(d+1\right)} \). This has been verified by a direct holographic computation of the retarded correlator for Einstein gravity in AdSd+1 black hole background. We compute corrections to the holographic shear sum rule in presence of higher derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find agreement between the sum rule obtained from a general CFT analysis and holographic computation for Gauss Bonnet theories in AdS5 black hole background. We then generalize the sum rule for arbitrary curvature squared corrections to Einstein-Hilbert action in d ≥ 4. Evaluating the parameters t2 and t4 for the possible dual CFT in presence of such curvature corrections, we find an agreement with the general field theory derivation to leading order in coupling constants of the higher derivative terms."
"Thermal out-of-time-order correlators, KMS relations, and spectral functions","We describe general features of thermal correlation functions in quantum systems, with specific focus on the fluctuation-dissipation type relations implied by the KMS condition. These end up relating correlation functions with different time ordering and thus should naturally be viewed in the larger context of out-of-time-ordered (OTO) observables. In particular, eschewing the standard formulation of KMS relations where thermal periodicity is combined with time-reversal to stay within the purview of Schwinger-Keldysh functional integrals, we show that there is a natural way to phrase them directly in terms of OTO correlators. We use these observations to construct a natural causal basis for thermal n-point functions in terms of fully nested commutators. We provide several general results which can be inferred from cyclic orbits of permutations, and exemplify the abstract results using a quantum oscillator as an explicit example."
"Studies in the Phaeotremella foliacea group (Tremellomycetes, Basidiomycota)","The taxonomy of the Phaeotremella foliacea group is revised based on morphological, ecological, geographic and DNA data. The name P. foliacea is retained for the gymnosperm-dwelling species associated with Stereum sanguinolentum in Eurasia and North America. Tremella neofoliacea and Cryptococcus skinneri are considered synonyms of P. foliacea s. str. Three other species in the complex inhabit deciduous trees. Of them, Phaeotremella fimbriata, comb. nov., is associated with Stereum rugosum; this species possesses blackening basidiocarps and small basidiospores, and it occurs in Europe. Its close relative is the East Asian Phaeotremella eugeniae, sp. nov., inhabiting Quercus mongolica and having larger basidiospores. The third species, Phaeotremella frondosa, comb. nov., produces the largest basidiospores in the genus and is associated either with S. rugosum (mainly in North Europe) or with other Stereum species (temperate Eurasia and North America). Additionally, Tremella nigrescens is typified and placed in the synonyms of P. frondosa, and two species, T. fuscosuccinea and T. roseotincta, are combined to Phaeotremella."

"HIFU, a noninvasive and effective treatment for chyluria: 15 years of experience","The current treatment therapies for chyluria are often invasive and recurrent. Here, we investigated a novel noninvasive treatment of chyluria with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and evaluated its clinical efficacy."
The Geometry of Cuboctahedra in Medieval Art in Anatolia,"Numerous examples of cuboctahedra found in medieval-era buildings whose dates range from the early twelfth to the early fifteenth century across in Turkey indicate the significant use of such geometrical entities. Here we focus particularly on cuboctahedra with carved-out surfaces. The results show that although the unit cell, which is a combination of cubes and tetrahedra, sufficiently explains all examples, the octahemioctahedron and stella octangula strengthen the possibility of tetrahedral packing with its dual network and indicate a “vector matrix”, as suggested by R. Buckminster Fuller. Therefore, their prevalent use as a “geometric solid” in a hollow cube frame and their appearance as an envelope of either tetrahedral packing or highly complex surfaces reveal almost 800-hundred-year-old examples of cuboctahedra as a Vector Equilibrium (VE) producing Isotropic Vector Matrix (IVM)."
Virus-like particles vaccine containing Clonorchis sinensis tegumental protein induces partial protection against Clonorchis sinensis infection,"Human clonorchiasis, caused by the infection of Clonorchis sinensis, is one of the major health problems in Southeast Asia. However, vaccine efficacy against C. sinensis infection remains largely unknown."
Design and realization of indoor VLC-Wi-Fi hybrid network,"Indoor wireless communication networking has received significant attention along with the growth of indoor data traffc. VLC (Visible Light Communication) as a novel wireless communication technology with the advantages of a high data rate, license-free spectrum and safety provides a practical solution for the indoor high-speed transmission of large data traffc. However, limited coverage is an inherent feature of VLC. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid VLC-Wi-Fi system that integrates multiple links to achieve an indoor high-speed wide-coverage network combined with multiple access, a multi-path transmission control protocol, mobility management and cell handover. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid network experiment platform, the experimental results of which show that the hybrid VLC-Wi-Fi network outperforms both single VLC and Wi-Fi networks with better coverage and greater network capacity."
Position encoded asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in visible light communications,"A PE-ACO-OFDM (Position-Encoded Asymmetrically Clipped Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signaling scheme for intensity modulation and direct detection is introduced in this paper, where the antiasymmetry characteristics of ACO-OFDM are exploited to improve the rate of data transmission. This is achieved by reducing the symbol duration of the ACO-OFDM signal, where only the first half of ACO-OFDM is used to transmit the ACO-OFDM data symbol after inverting its negative samples to positive ones. In addition, encoded ACO-OFDM samples are combined with every ACO-OFDM symbol to allow the receiver to identify the position of the inverted samples. Simulation results are introduced, and it is shown that the data rates of PE-ACO-OFDM improve by 33% compared with ACO-OFDM, when a 256-quadrature amplitude modulation scheme is considered as the encoded constellation order. It is also shown that the signal to noise ratio of the proposed PE-ACO-OFDM is higher by almost 1 dB compared with the traditional ACO-OFDM."
Zonal based approach for clustering in heterogeneous WSN,"Huge attention of the researchers is drawn by the wireless sensor network (WSN) due to its applicability in variety of applications. WSN has tiny size low powered device called sensors with an objective to monitor the area of interest. In many applications of WSN, it is impossible to modify the topology or to replace the battery based power supply of the sensor nodes. Hence elongation of network lifetime is required to meet the objective of setting up the network. In this paper, a zonal based clustering technique is proposed wherein the field is divided into zones. The selection of cluster head is dynamic so as to balance the load with even dissipation of power by the deployed Sensor Node. The proposed work is compared with DEEC, SEP, Z-SEP and LEACH protocol and simulation validates the protocol with elongated stability region and extended life time with more successful packet delivery to base station."
The role of self-esteem in the development of psychiatric problems: a three-year prospective study in a clinical sample of adolescents,"Self-esteem is fundamentally linked to mental health, but its’ role in trajectories of psychiatric problems is unclear. In particular, few studies have addressed the role of self-esteem in the development of attention problems. Hence, we examined the role of global self-esteem in the development of symptoms of anxiety/depression and attention problems, simultaneously, in a clinical sample of adolescents while accounting for gender, therapy, and medication."

Visualising urban energy use: the use of LiDAR and remote sensing data in urban energy planning,"This paper explores the potential for using remotely sensed data from a combination of commercial and open-sources, to improve the functionality, accuracy of energy-use calculations and visualisation of carbon emissions. We present a study demonstrating the use of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and aerial imagery for a mixed-use inner urban area within the North East of England and how this can improve the quality of input data for modelling standardised energy uses and carbon emissions. We explore the scope of possible input data for both (1) building geometry and (2) building physics models from these sources."
The CogBIAS longitudinal study protocol: cognitive and genetic factors influencing psychological functioning in adolescence,Optimal psychological development is dependent upon a complex interplay between individual and situational factors. Investigating the development of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional vulnerability and resilience. The CogBIAS longitudinal study (CogBIAS-L-S) aims to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent sample.
A network modeling approach to elucidate drug resistance mechanisms and predict combinatorial drug treatments in breast cancer,"Mechanistic models of within-cell signal transduction networks can explain how these networks integrate internal and external inputs to give rise to the appropriate cellular response. These models can be fruitfully used in cancer cells, whose aberrant decision-making regarding their survival or death, proliferation or quiescence can be connected to errors in the state of nodes or edges of the signal transduction network."
A long-term survival case treated with conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy for pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis,"Pancreatic cancer with distant metastases is classified as “unresectable,” for which the standard treatment is systemic chemotherapy. The effectiveness of radical resection for pancreatic cancer with distant metastases is unknown. Here, we report a case of long term survival treated with conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy for pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis."
Three-dimensional structures of Mn doped CoP on flexible carbon cloth for effective oxygen evolution reaction,"The development of electrocatalysts with high activity and low cost has attracted growing attentions in recent years. Herein, we reported the Mn-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on flexible activated carbon cloth (Mn–CoP/CC) for the effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low overpotential and high current density. Due to the novel 3D nanostructures of the carbon cloth and doping effect of the Mn element, the Mn doped CoP/CC electrode delivered the best overpotential of 317 mV for water splitting with the current density of 10 mA/cm2, a Tafel slope of ∼65.1 mV/dec, and excellent stability over 16 h in 1.0 mol/L KOH, which is superior or comparable to the most of the reported cobalt-based catalysts. Thus outstanding electrocatalytic performance originates from the Mn doping effect, which resulted in increased surface area and fast charge-transfer. It is believed that these findings would help us to develop high effective and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting."

The Effects of Quinine on Neurophysiological Properties of Dopaminergic Neurons,"Quinine is an antimalarial drug that is toxic to the auditory system by commonly inducing hearing loss and tinnitus, presumably due to its ototoxic effects on disruption of cochlear hair cells and blockade of ion channels of neurons in the auditory system. To a lesser extent, quinine also causes ataxia, tremor, and dystonic reactions. As dopaminergic neurons are implicated to play a role in all of these diseases, we tested the toxicity of quinine on induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and primary dopaminergic (DA) neurons of substantia nigra from mice brain slices. Patch clamp recordings and combined drug treatments were performed to examine key physiological properties of the DA neurons. We found that quinine (12.5–200 μM) depolarized the resting membrane potential and attenuated the amplitudes of rebound spikes induced by hyperpolarization. Action potentials were also broadened in spontaneously spiking neurons. In addition to quinine attenuating hyperpolarization-dependent conductance, the tail currents following withdrawal of hyperpolarizing currents were also attenuated. Taken together, we found that iPSC-derived DA neurons recapitulated all the tested physiological properties of human DA neurons, and quinine had distinct effects on the physiology of both iDA and primary DA neurons. This toxicity of quinine may be the underlying mechanism for the movement disorders of cinchonism or quinism and may play a role in tinnitus modulation."

X-ray spectroscopic and stroboscopic analysis of pulsed-laser ablation of Zn and its oxidation,"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) as an attractive process for ligand-free nanoparticle synthesis represents a multiscale problem to understand the mechanisms and achieve control. Atomic and nanoscale processes interacting with macroscale dynamics in the liquid demand for sensitive tools for in-situ and structural analysis. By adding X-ray methods, we enlarge the available information on millimeter-scale bubble formation down to atomic-scale nanoparticle reactions. X-ray spectroscopy (XAS) can resolve the chemical speciation of the ablated material during the ablation from a zinc wire target showing a first oxidation step from zinc to zinc oxide within some 10 min followed by a slower reaction to hydrozincite. X-ray imaging investigations also give additional information on the bubble dynamics as we demonstrate by comparing the microsecond radiography and optical stroboscopy. We show different features of the detachment of the ablation bubble from a free wire. The location of the first collapse occurs in front of the target. While a first rebound bubble possesses an homogeneous interior, the subsequent rebound consists merely of a cloud of microbubbles."
Influence of Drying on the Recoverable High-Value Products from Olive (cv. Arbequina) Waste Cake,"Olive oil production in Chile has increased 900% in the last 10 years, resulting in a concomitant increase in waste products that need to be managed. In this study, drying assays were conducted in a convective hot-air dryer on Arbequina olive waste cakes between 40 and 90 °C and a constant airflow of 2 m/s. Proximate composition, dietary fiber, minerals, fatty acids, tocopherols, phytochemicals as well as antioxidant activity as DPPH, FRAP and ORAC values were determined. These six drying temperatures were found to have variable effects on general composition of the residues. Fatty acids were found in high concentration at low temperatures where oleic acid was the most abundant and α-tocopherol was the most prevalent form of vitamin E. The phytochemical content (total phenolics, flavonoids and flavanols) represented an average of 20.7% of the waste cake. Fresh cake showed the highest polyphenols and flavonoids content whereas flavanols content was higher at all drying temperatures. 3-Hydroxytyrosol was the most abundant phenolic compound, and found in higher abundance in samples dried at 90 °C. The antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP and DPPH assays decreased with drying or remained unchanged when measured by ORAC assay. Given the nutritional and commercial potential of waste cakes, a drying technology for the preservation of bioactive compounds from waste products is discussed."
Accurate fluid force measurement based on control surface integration,"Nonintrusive 3D fluid force measurements are still challenging to conduct accurately for freely moving animals, vehicles, and deforming objects. Two techniques, 3D particle image velocimetry (PIV) and a new technique, the aerodynamic force platform (AFP), address this. Both rely on the control volume integral for momentum; whereas PIV requires numerical integration of flow fields, the AFP performs the integration mechanically based on rigid walls that form the control surface. The accuracy of both PIV and AFP measurements based on the control surface integration is thought to hinge on determining the unsteady body force associated with the acceleration of the volume of displaced fluid. Here, I introduce a set of non-dimensional error ratios to show which fluid and body parameters make the error negligible. The unsteady body force is insignificant in all conditions where the average density of the body is much greater than the density of the fluid, e.g., in gas. Whenever a strongly deforming body experiences significant buoyancy and acceleration, the error is significant. Remarkably, this error can be entirely corrected for with an exact factor provided that the body has a sufficiently homogenous density or acceleration distribution, which is common in liquids. The correction factor for omitting the unsteady body force, \({{{ {\rho _{\text{f}}}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{1 - {\rho _{\text{f}}}} {\left( {{\rho _{\text{b}}}\;+\;{\rho _{\text{f}}}} \right)}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\left( {{{{\rho }}_{\text{b}}}\;+\;{\rho _{\text{f}}}} \right)}}} ,\) depends only on the fluid, \({\rho _{\text{f}}}\), and body, \({{\rho }}_{\text{b}}\), density. Whereas these straightforward solutions work even at the liquid–gas interface in a significant number of cases, they do not work for generalized bodies undergoing buoyancy in combination with appreciable body density inhomogeneity, volume change (PIV), or volume rate-of-change (PIV and AFP). In these less common cases, the 3D body shape needs to be measured and resolved in time and space to estimate the unsteady body force. The analysis shows that accounting for the unsteady body force is straightforward to non-intrusively and accurately determine fluid force in most applications."
An arc-shaped crack in nonlinear fully coupled thermoelectric materials,"We present a rigorous treatment to the problem of a circular-arc crack in an infinite thermoelectric solid subjected to a combined electrical and thermal loading. Formulating the problem in terms of the complex potentials and reducing it to the Hilbert arc problem, the solutions of quantities in both thermoelectric field and the associated thermoelastic field are presented in a closed form based on the electrically permeable and thermally insulated crack model. The results show that the fields of heat flux, energy flux, and stress exhibit the traditional square-root singularity at tips of arc crack. The applied electric current and energy flux generate both mode I and mode II stress intensity factors (SIFs), which are dependent on the loading direction, electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, central angle of the crack, and thermoelastic isotropy. Electrically induced SIF is a quadratic function of applied electric current density, and thermally induced SIF is a linear function of the imposed total energy flux. In addition, the effects of the loading direction and half crack angle on the thermal SIFs are also presented in a graphic form. This is the first theoretical paper to study the effect of the crack shape on the fracture of fully coupled thermoelectric materials by a rigorous inference of physics and mathematics."
Dual-technique-based inline design strategy for water-hammer control in pressurized pipe flow,"A dual-technique-based inline strategy was investigated in this study as a sustainment to conventional-technique skills in terms of limitation of wave oscillation period spread-out. Instead of the single polymeric short section employed by the latter technique, the former is based on replacing an up- and downstream short section of the primitive piping system using another couple made of polymeric pipe-wall material. Numerical computations used the method of characteristics for the discretization of unconventional water-hammer model based on the Vitkovsky and the Kelvin–Voigt formulations. The efficiency of the dual technique was considered for two operating conditions associated with up- and downsurge frames. Moreover, two pipe-wall material types were utilized for short-section pipe wall, namely the HDPE or LDPE materials. Additionally, the conventional technique was also addressed in this study, for comparison purposes. First, analyses of pressure-head, circumferential-stress and radial-strain wave patterns, along with wave oscillation periods examination, confirmed that the dual technique could improve the efficiency of the conventional one, providing acceptable trade-off between the attenuation of pressure-head and circumferential-stress peaks (or crests), and limitation of period spreading and radial-strain amplification. Second, a parametric study of the sensitivity of the wave damping to the employed short-section dimensions was performed in terms of short-section length and diameter. This parametric study helped estimate the near-optimal values of the short-section dimensions."
Imperfection and tangential edge constraint sensitivities of thermomechanical nonlinear response of pressure-loaded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite cylindrical panels,"Initial geometrical imperfection and elasticity of tangential edge constraints are inherent in real structures in general and composite cylindrical panels in particular. This paper investigates the nonlinear response of functionally graded nanocomposite cylindrical panels reinforced by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), exposed to thermal environments and subjected to uniform external pressure. The material properties of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composites (FG-CNTRC) are assumed to be temperature dependent, graded in the thickness direction, and are estimated by the extended rule of mixture through a micromechanical model. The governing equations are based on classical shell theory taking von Kármán–Donnell nonlinearity, initial geometrical imperfection and tangential constraints of boundary edges into consideration. Approximate solutions of deflection and stress functions are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions, and the Galerkin method is applied to obtain closed-form expressions of load–deflection relations. An analysis of separate and simultaneous influences of carbon nanotube volume fraction and distribution types, geometrical parameters, varying degree of tangential edge constraints, thermal environments, geometrical imperfection and temperature dependence of material properties on the buckling behavior and load-carrying capacity of FG-CNTRC cylindrical panels results in interesting remarks and novelty of the present study."
"Genomic analysis of a novel picornavirus from a migratory waterfowl, greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons)","The complete genome of goose picornavirus 1 (GPV-1) strain goose/NLSZK2/HUN/2013 (MF358731) was determined by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing from a cloacal sample of a migratory waterfowl, greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) in Hungary. The genome of GPV-1 shows an L-3-3-4 organization pattern with a 5’-terminal origin of replication (ORI) region, a type-IV IRES, and an Hbox/NC-type 2A protein. This virus showed the highest overall sequence identity to the members of the genus Kobuvirus, although the phylogenetic position of GPV-1 is different in the analyzed P1, 2C and 3CD phylogenetic trees, which further increases the diversity of known avian picornaviruses."
Procedural complications of endovascular treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage treated at a single centre,"We present a single-centre experience of procedural complications suffered by patients undergoing endovascular treatment for a ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysm at Tampere University Hospital, Finland, between 2000 and 2014."
Transit time corrected arterial spin labeling technique aids to overcome delayed transit time effect,This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of transit time corrected cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps based on multi-phase arterial spin labeling MR perfusion imaging (ASL-MRP).
Derivatives and differentials for multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy information,"By using the unsymmetrical scale instead of the symmetrical scale, the multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy sets (MIFSs) reflect our intuition more objectively. Each element in a MIFS is expressed by an ordered pair which is called a multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy number (MIFN) and is based on the unbalanced scale (i.e., Saaty’s 1-9 scale). In order to describe the derivatives and differentials for multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy information more comprehensively, in this paper, we firstly propose two new basic operational laws for MIFNs, which are the subtraction law and the division law. Secondly, we describe the change values of MIFNs when considering them as variables, classify these change values based on the basic operational laws for MIFNs, and depict the convergences of sequences of MIFNs by the subtraction and division laws. Finally, we focus on the multiplicative intuitionistic fuzzy functions and derive some basic results related to their continuities, derivatives and differentials, and also give their application in selecting the configuration of a computer."

Feature selection of ultrahigh-dimensional covariates with survival outcomes: a selective review,"Many modern biomedical studies have yielded survival data with high-throughput predictors. The goals of scientific research often lie in identifying predictive biomarkers, understanding biological mechanisms and making accurate and precise predictions. Variable screening is a crucial first step in achieving these goals. This work conducts a selective review of feature screening procedures for survival data with ultrahigh dimensional covariates. We present the main methodologies, along with the key conditions that ensure sure screening properties. The practical utility of these methods is examined via extensive simulations. We conclude the review with some future opportunities in this field."
Image segmentation by level set evolution with region consistency constraint,"Image segmentation is a key and fundamental problem in image processing, computer graphics, and computer vision. Level set based method for image segmentation is used widely for its topology flexibility and proper mathematical formulation. However, poor performance of existing level set models on noisy images and weak boundary limit its application in image segmentation. In this paper, we present a region consistency constraint term to measure the regional consistency on both sides of the boundary, this term defines the boundary of the image within a range, and hence increases the stability of the level set model. The term can make existing level set models significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithms on segmenting images with noise and weak boundary. Furthermore, this constraint term can make edge-based level set model overcome the defect of sensitivity to the initial contour. The experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient for image segmentation and outperform the existing state-of-art methods regarding images with noise and weak boundary."
Competitive analysis of price online inventory problem with cost function,"In this paper, a new price is given to the online decision maker at the beginning of each day.

The competitive ratio of the online algorithm is given for each variant, which is a performance measure of an online algorithm. More importantly, we show that the online algorithm is optimal."

Novel Benzidine and o-Phenylenediamine Copolymer–Matrix Microcomposites,"Poly(benzidine-co-o-phenylenediamine)/bentonite composites were fabricated utilizing several bentonite percentages by a facile oxidative copolymerization. The composites were clarified by means of FT-IR and UV–Vis absorption spectra of both poly(benzidine-co-o-phenylenediamine) emeraldine base, and poly(benzidine-co-o-phenylenediamine)/bentonite composite. The conjunction of o-phenylenediamine monomer with polybenzidine skeleton in the existence of bentonite was proven. TGA analyses under non-oxidative condition were studied. Moreover, at different magnifications, SEM of bentonite composite was examined having micrometric particle sizes in the range of 0.24–0.80 μm. A comparison of XRD patterns of the synthesized polymer and composite was discussed."
Preparation of Cadmium Sulfide/Polystyrene Nanocomposites Films Using Gamma Irradiation,"In the present study we have synthesized Cadmium Sulfide/Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CdS/CTAB) nanoparticles + by the gamma ray irradiation method and then embedded in polystyrene polymer with different concentration (2, 5 and 10 wt%) forming CdS/PS nanocomposites using solution casting method. The as-prepared CdS/CTAB nanoparticles and CdS/PS nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/Vis) absorption, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD results indicated the formation of CdS nanoparticles with hexagonal phase. FTIR data suggesting interaction of the alkyl ammonium head group of CTAB with the CdS nanoparticle surface. UV–Vis spectroscopy revealed that the CdS/PS nanocomposites films showed quantum confinement effect. The TGA results showed incorporation of CdS nanoparticles significantly enhance the thermal properties of PS matrix. The photoluminescence spectra of CdS/PS nanocomposites films show two emission bands arising from the presence of CdS nanoparticles."
Descriptive Proximities. Properties and Interplay Between Classical Proximities and Overlap,"The theory of descriptive nearness is usually adopted when dealing with subsets that share some common properties, even when the subsets are not spatially close. Set description arises from the use of probe functions to define feature vectors that describe a set; nearness is given by proximities. A probe on a nonempty set X is an n-dimensional, real-valued function that maps each member of X to its description. We establish a connection between relations on an object space X and relations on the corresponding feature space. In this paper, the starting point is what is known as \(\mathcal {P}_\Phi \) proximity (two sets are \(\mathcal {P}_\Phi \)-near or \(\Phi \)-descriptively near if and only if their \(\Phi \)-descriptions intersect). We extend, elucidate and explain the connection between overlap and strong proximity in a theoretical approach to a more visual form of proximity called descriptive proximity, which leads to a number of applications. Descriptive proximities are considered on two different levels: weaker or stronger than the \(\mathcal {P}_\Phi \) proximity. We analyze the properties and interplay between descriptions on the one hand and classical proximities and overlap relations on the other hand. Axioms and results for a descriptive Lodato strong proximity relation are given. A common descriptive proximity is an Efremovič proximity, whose underlying topology is \(R_0\) (symmetry axiom) and Alexandroff-Hopf. For every description \(\Phi \), any Čech, Lodato or EF \(\Phi \)-descriptive proximity is at the same time a Čech, Lodato or EF-proximity, respectively. But, the converse fails. A detailed practical application is given in terms of the construction of Efremovič descriptive proximity planograms, which complements recent operations research work on the allocation of shelf space in visual merchandising. Specific instances of applications of descriptive proximity are also cited."
"Alterations in lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism distinguish Crohn’s disease from ulcerative colitis and control subjects by serum metabolomic profiling","Biomarkers are needed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to help define disease activity and identify underlying pathogenic mechanisms. We hypothesized that serum metabolomics, which produces unique metabolite profiles, can aid in this search."
De novo metastasis in breast cancer: occurrence and overall survival stratified by molecular subtype,"Breast cancer molecular subtypes, categorized jointly by hormone receptors (HR) and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2), are utilized to guide systemic therapy. We hypothesized distinct patterns of de novo metastasis and overall survival by molecular subtype using a retrospective cohort of 399,772 women in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with first primary invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2014, of whom 13,924 were diagnosed with de novo metastasis from 2010 to 2013 and had follow up data. The relationship of molecular subtype with patient and tumor characteristics, including site of de novo metastasis, were examined using Chi-squared tests. Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine overall survival by molecular subtype. Bone was the most frequent de novo metastatic site for all molecular subtypes. Compared to HR+/HER2−, patients with HR−/HER2+ experienced 4.5, 3.0, and 6.0 times the de novo brain, lung, and liver metastasis respectively. In survival analyses of women diagnosed with de novo metastasis, the mortality risk relative to HR+/HER2− was twice as high for triple-negative (hazard ratio = 2.02, 95% CI 1.89–2.16) and modestly lower for HR+/HER2+ (hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78–0.88). The median survival difference between metastatic patients with and without chemotherapy was 28.6 months in HR+/HER2+ and 28.2 months in HR−/HER2+, but only 10.9 months in triple-negative and 5.2 months in HR+/HER2−. In conclusion, despite unfavorable patterns of de novo metastasis, HER2+ breast cancers had relatively better survival in recent years, probably due to treatment differences. Utilizing molecular subtype and site of de novo metastasis may predict prognosis and guide treatment."
Modeling and analysis for stock return movements along with exchange rates and interest rates in Markov regime-switching models,"Since the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis, the regime shift behavior has been notable in the stock markets. We examine the effects of interest rates and foreign exchange rates on stock returns and the cross-correlations of Korean stock returns associated with three other countries: Japan, USA, and China, using the Hamilton 2-regime Markov Switching model, for the period January 1993–December 2016. In both regimes, the volatility in the Korean stock market is greater than Japan and USA, but less than China. In regime 1 with low-volatility, the stock returns of both Korea and Japan are significantly affected first by their exchange rates and then by their interest rates. In regime 2 with high-volatility, the Korean stock market is explained by neither of the two exogenous variables while the Japanese stock returns respond positively to the exchange rates but negatively to the interest rates. The transition probability from regime 1 to regime 2 is greater than the reverse probability in the Korean stock market, which is opposite in Japan. Considering all four countries simultaneously, the Korean stock market is highly influenced by both the US and Japanese stock market in regime 1 with low-volatility, but only influenced by the Japanese stock market in regime 2 with high-volatility."
Association but not Recognition: an Alternative Model for Differential Imitation from 0 to 2 Months,"Skepticism toward the existence of neonatal differential imitation is fostered by views that assign it an excessive significance, making it foundational for social cognition. Moreover, a misleading theoretical framework may generate unwarranted expectations about the kinds of findings experimentalists are supposed to look for. Hence we propose a theoretical analysis that may help experimentalists address the empirical question of whether early differential imitation really exists. We distinguish three models of early imitation. The first posits automatic visuo-motor links evolved for sociocognitive functions and we call it Genetically Programmed Direct Matching (GPDM). The second is Meltzoff and Moore’s Active Intermodal Matching (AIM), which postulates a comparison between the acts of self and other. The third is the alternative we propose and we call it “Association by Similarity Theory” (AST), as it relies on the tacit functioning of this domain-general process. AST describes early imitation merely as the differential induction or elicitation of behaviors that already tend to occur spontaneously. We focus on the contrast between AIM and AST, and argue that AST is preferable to AIM for two reasons. First, AST is more parsimonious and more plausible, especially because it does not require infants to be able to recognize self-other similarities. Second, whereas the extant findings tend to disqualify AIM, AST can account for them adequately. Furthermore, we suggest that AST has the potential to give new impulse to empirical research because it discriminates promising lines of inquiry from unproductive ones."
STOP-Bang questionnaire: the validation of a Portuguese version as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in primary care,"The growing number of suspected patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that are observed in sleep units has increased in the last decade.

Are some sharks more social than others? Short- and long-term consistencies in the social behavior of juvenile lemon sharks,"Despite substantial research interest in understanding individual-level consistency in behavioral attributes, significant knowledge gaps remain across traits and taxa. For example, relatively few studies have looked at social personality in large marine species such as elasmobranchs and whether or not individual differences in behavior are maintained in unstable social groups (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics). However, it is important to investigate this topic in other model species than the usually small species with short generation times typically investigated in these areas of behavioral ecology. Indeed, studies on ecologically diverse taxa could provide mechanistic insights into the emergence and maintenance of animal personality and dynamics of social groups in animals. In addition, understanding social behavior at the group- and individual-level could improve conservation management of these large animals with long generation times (e.g., removal of particular behavioral types by fisheries practices). Here, we investigated consistent individual differences in sociability in wild juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) over both short- (4 to 18 days) and long-term (4 months) sampling periods. Individual sharks were observed in social groups and scored according to the number of social interactions performed during observations. Despite variable individual group compositions between repeated trials, sharks showed consistent individual differences in their social behavior over both time scales. These results suggest reduced plasticity and highlight individuality as an important explanatory variable for the social dynamics of juvenile lemon sharks. In addition, long-term stability observed in this wild population demonstrates the importance of personality in the daily behavioral repertoire of juvenile lemon sharks. Our results are discussed in the context of other shark studies and taxonomic groups and potential avenues for future research are proposed."
Male white-handed gibbons flexibly time duet contributions,"Vocal duetting occurs when two individuals produce repeated, stereotyped vocalizations, often with alternating contributions. It evolved independently in many pair living taxa. Among hominoids, only hylobatids duet, but little is known about how mated pairs coordinate singing and if individuals adjust their song to spectral and temporal aspects of another’s song. If they do, this would demonstrate vocal flexibility not yet well documented in apes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed duets of wild white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), quantifying female notes and the timing of male notes relative to them. We measured changes in female notes that preceded her great call phrase and that she initiated only after her mate had stopped singing. We predicted males would suspend their own song during a female’s great call phrase in anticipation of her climax, and thus should interrupt abnormal female calls, because these typically fail to climax. We compared (1) interrupted great call phrases females aborted, (2) interrupted phrases that were completed, and (3) uninterrupted, completed phrases. We found that abnormal great call phrases were interrupted by males, likely because the male anticipated that the phrase would be abandoned before reaching its climax. Although female call phrases varied in length, we also found that males replied in close synchrony with their ending. Subtle spectral and temporal variations in song influenced the timing of a mate’s singing and thus the structure and delivery of duets. Although ape vocal behavior is thought to be largely innate, our findings show unexpected flexibility in song expression."
Impact of holistic review on student interview pool diversity,"Diversity in the physician workforce lags behind the rapidly changing US population. Since the gateway to becoming a physician is medical school, diversity must be addressed in the admissions process. The Association of American Medical Colleges has implemented a Holistic Review Initiative aimed at assisting medical schools with broadening admission criteria to include relevant, mission-driven attributes and experiences in addition to academic preparation to identify applicants poised to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. More evidence is needed to determine whether holistic review results in a more diverse selection process. One of the keys to holistic review is to apply holistic principles in all stages of the selection process to ensure qualified applicants are not overlooked. This study examines whether the use of holistic review during application screening at a new medical school increased the diversity of applicants selected for interview. Using retrospective data from the first five application cycles at the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine (OUWB), the author compared demographic and experiential differences between the applicants selected using holistic review, including experiences, attributes and academic metrics, to a test sample selected solely using academic metrics. The dataset consisted of the total group of applicants selected for interview in 2011 through 2015 using holistic review (n = 2773) and the same number of applicants who would have been selected for an interview using an academic-only selection model (n = 2773), which included 1204 applicants who were selected using both methods (final n = 4342). The author used a combination of cross-tabulation and analysis of variance to identify differences between applicants selected using holistic review and applicants in the test sample selected using only academics. The holistic review process yielded a significantly higher than expected percent of female (adj. resid. = 13.2, p < .01), traditionally underrepresented in medicine (adj. resid. = 15.8, p < .01), first generation (adj. resid. = 5.8, p < .01), and self-identified disadvantaged (adj resid. = 11.5, p < .01) applicants in the interview pool than selected using academic metrics alone. In addition, holistically selected applicants averaged significantly more hours than academically selected students in the areas of pre-medical school paid employment (F = 10.99, mean difference = 657.99, p < .01) and community service (F = 15.36, mean difference = 475.58, p < .01). Using mission-driven, holistic admissions criteria comprised of applicant attributes and experiences in addition to academic metrics resulted in a more diverse interview pool than using academic metrics alone. These findings add support for the use of holistic review in the application screening process as a means for increasing diversity in medical school interview pools."
Insight into the Effects of Reinforcement Shape on Achieving Continuous Martensite Transformation in Phase Transforming Matrix Composites,"A continuous martensite transformation is indispensable for achieving large linear superelasticity and low modulus in phase transforming metal-based composites. However, determining how to accurately condition the residual martensite in a shape memory alloy matrix though the reinforcement shape to achieve continuous martensite transformation has been a challenge. Here, we take the finite element method to perform a comparative study of the effects of nanoinclusion shape on the interaction and martensite phase transformation in this new composite. Two typical samples are compared: one reinforced by metallic nanowires and the other by nanoparticles. We find that the residual martensite within the shape memory alloy matrix after a pretreatment can be tailored by the reinforcement shape. In particular, our results show that the shape memory alloy matrix can retain enough residual martensite phases to achieve continuous martensite transformation in the subsequent loading when the aspect ratio of nanoreinforcement is larger than 20. In contrast, the composites reinforced with spherical or low aspect ratio reinforcement show a typical nonlinear superelasticity as a result of a low stress transfer-induced discontinuous martensite transformation within the shape memory alloy matrix."

Abstract analysis method facilitates filtering low-methodological quality and high-bias risk systematic reviews on psoriasis interventions,"Article summaries’ information and structure may influence researchers/clinicians’ decisions to conduct deeper full-text analyses. Specifically, abstracts of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MA) should provide structured summaries for quick assessment. This study explored a method for determining the methodological quality and bias risk of full-text reviews using abstract information alone."
"Facility-imposed barriers to early utilization of focused antenatal care services in Mangochi District, Malawi – a mixed methods assessment","Focused Antenatal Care (FANC) is advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a key service approach to improving the health of pregnant women. Four targeted visits to antenatal clinics are recommended starting in the first trimester. First trimester attendance for FANC in Mangochi District, Malawi was low at 8%. FANC has mainly been promoted through health facility based communication activities with less emphasis on activities at community level. We developed and tested a community focused health communication approach “Community Driven Total FANC Attendance (CDTFA)” with the aim of increasing FANC clinic attendance. We included a research component in order to understand the context and responses of community members to this intervention."

A hybrid K-means and integer programming method for commercial territory design: a case study in meat distribution,"The objective of territorial design for a distribution company is the definition of geographic areas that group customers. These geographic areas, usually called districts or territories, should comply with operational rules while maximizing potential sales and minimizing incurred costs. Consequently, territorial design can be seen as a clustering problem in which clients are geographically grouped according to certain criteria which usually vary according to specific objectives and requirements (e.g. costs, delivery times, workload, number of clients, etc.). In this work, we provide a novel hybrid approach for territorial design by means of combining a K-means-based approach for clustering construction with an optimization framework. The K-means approach incorporates the novelty of using tour length approximation techniques to satisfy the conditions of a pork and poultry distributor based in the region of Valparaíso in Chile. The resulting method proves to be robust in the experiments performed, and the Valparaíso case study shows significant savings when compared to the original solution used by the company."
The utility of personal activity trackers (Fitbit Charge 2) on exercise capacity in patients post acute coronary syndrome [UP-STEP ACS Trial]: a randomised controlled trial protocol,"The benefits of physical activity and cardiovascular rehabilitation on the reduction of cardiovascular risk are well documented.

Experimental research on the relationship between the stiffness and the expressions of fibronectin proteins and adaptor proteins of rat trabecular meshwork cells,Trabecular meshwork (TM) plays an important role in maintaining normal intraocular pressure (IOP). Studies have shown that glaucomatous TM tissues are stiffer than those of normal tissue. The high expression of fibronectin protein (FN) and adaptor protein (LNK) may be related to high resistance to aqueous humor outflow as well as high IOP. Our concern is what factors lead to the variation of the stiffness of trabecular tissue/cells.
Comparison of efficacy between coaxial microincision and standard-incision phacoemulsification in patients with age-related cataracts: a meta-analysis,"Incision size plays a critical role in the efficacy of cataract surgery, but the available evidence on ideal incision size is inconsistent.

Area-wide spatial survey of the likelihood of insecticide control failure in the neotropical brown stink bug Euschistus heros,"Insecticide resistance is a well-known phenomenon caused by the intensive use of insecticides, which selected resistant individuals and cause large economic losses. The use of area-wide surveys and geostatistical analyses are important management initiatives as they enable the recognition of areas with high risks of insecticide control failure due to insecticide resistance. Here, we surveyed and mapped the risk of insecticide control failure in populations of the neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, in one of the main soybean-producing areas in the Neotropical region, the state of Goiás in central Brazil. Diagnostic bioassays were performed using the recommended label rates and minimum required control efficacy threshold for commercial formulations of the main compounds used against this pest species in the region, namely the pyrethroids beta-cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and the organophosphate acephate. The control failure likelihood for the insecticides acephate, lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam was negligible throughout the surveyed region. However, a low risk of control failure exists for beta-cyfluthrin at localized portions of southwestern Goiás and for imidacloprid in the northeast. These findings diverge from the perceived and apparently unjustified notion that the reported insecticide control failure against this stink bug is due to insecticide resistance. Indeed, this problem is currently limited to just two insecticides (i.e., beta-cyfluthrin and imidacloprid) in circumscribed portions of the surveyed area. Thus, resistance management efforts should be specifically designed to address these areas, and more general approaches should continue to be employed in the whole of the region."
Patient satisfaction with robotic surgery,"This study is a service evaluation of the robotic-assisted surgery service within the Gynaecology Oncology department at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The aim is not only to evaluate and improve this new service within the department, but also to add to the available literature that reviews patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted surgery. An anonymous questionnaire was developed with questions taken from the NHS User Experience Survey Question Bank and additional questions in the same format specific to robotic-assisted surgery. This was posted to the first 140 patients to have undergone robotic-assisted surgery within Gynae Oncology at STH. One hundred completed questionnaires were returned. Over 90% of patients were pleased with the care that they received pre-operatively and felt that they have enough input into the decisions made about treatment. Half of patients (51%) reported having pain post-procedure, with a quarter of these patients experiencing severe pain. The majority of patients (72%) felt that their length of stay in hospital was of the right duration. Almost all patients (99%) were pleased with the overall care that they received and 91% would recommend robotic-assisted surgery as a modality. Patients are very satisfied with the care that they receive when undergoing robotic-assisted surgery within Gynae Oncology at our center and the majority of patients would recommend robotic-assisted surgery as a modality."
Optimizing model parameter for entity summarization across knowledge graphs,"Knowledge graphs, which belongs to the category of semantic networks, are considered as a new method of knowledge representation of health care data. It establishes a semantic explanation model for human perception and health care information processing. Each knowledge graph is composed of massive entities and relationships. However, it is an arduous work to search and visualize users’ interested entities and attributes since there are many attributes for an entity across different knowledge graphs. It is a natural problem how to summarize an entity based on multiple knowledge graphs. We propose a three-stage algorithm to solve the problem of entity summarization across knowledge graphs, including candidate generation, knowledge graph linkage, and entity summarization. We propose an unsupervised framework to link different knowledge graphs based on the semantic and structure information of entities. To further reduce the computational cost, we employ word embedding technique to find the similar entities in semantic, and filter some pairs of unmatched entities. Finally, we model entity summarization as personalized ranking problem in a knowledge graph. We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate our proposed method on four real datasets: historical data for user query, two English knowledge graphs (YAGO and DBpeida) and an English corpus. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing with baselines."
"Mobile robot scheduling for cycle time optimization in flow-shop cells, a case study","The typical production system in carton box production companies is cell-production. These cells normally benefit from a mobile robot which serves the machines according to a given schedule. One of the main problems of such companies is finding the order of robot moves in a way that the time required for completing all jobs is minimized. In the studied case in this research, each cell contains three machines of which, two or three of them might be activated for production process depending on the product type. These machines are equipped with a one-capacitated input and output buffer. Considering the fact that the machines are capable of performing any operation, the assignments of the jobs to them may have several alternatives. The one-capacitated buffers make the robot scheduling more complex as they act as extra stations to be served by the robot (contribute to exponential increase in job assignments permutation). This study aims to deal with this complexity and provide a decision-making toolbox for business owners to determine and employ the best robot moving schedule according to the characteristics of the problem. The mentioned approach significantly contributes to decision-maker’s effective time management and results in adopting a better production scheme for each production cycle. In line with this prospect, this research proposes a sequential part production matrix (SPPM) to determine feasible robot move strategies through which the best scheduling scheme is introduced for different problem configurations. Additionally, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the best robot move strategy for cases with more active machines in a cell as manual determination of the robot move strategies becomes exhaustive in such cases."
Impact Assessment of Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide Treated Organically Modified Nanoclay-Polymer Composite on Soil Enzyme Activity and Root Volume,"The effect of organically modified nanoclay-polymer composite was evaluated on soil enzyme activity and root volume at different growth stages viz. crown root initiation, tillering and panicle initiation of wheat (variety: HD 3059). Nanoclay-polymer composite was synthesized by in -situ polymerization of acrylic acid-acrylamide in presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide @ 60% neutralization degree and 0.5% cross-linker level and subsequently loaded with di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer (14 g di-ammonium phosphate per unit weight of nanoclay-polymer composite). Phosphorus loaded nanoclay-polymer composite and conventional diammonium phosphate fertilizer were applied (P dose-40 mg P2O5 kg−1 soil) to two types of soil (Alfisol and Inceptisol). Soil enzyme activity and root volume were studied independently with a factorial completely randomized design experiment. Results revealed that dehydrogenase enzyme activity in modified nanoclay-polymer composite increased by + 26.3 and + 19% over conventional fertilizer in Alfisol and Inceptisol respectively. Acid phosphatase activity (9.25 µg p-nitrophenol g−1 soil h−1) was highest at panicle initiation stage in Inceptisol whereas alkaline phosphatase activity was more at tillering in both soils. Root volume also increased by + 16.8% on applying nanoclay-polymer composite as compared to conventional fertilizer in Alfisol. The corresponding data in Inceptisol was + 13.1%. Therefore, it was concluded that nanoclay-polymer composite prepared from organoclay has a positive effect on soil enzyme activity as well as root volume."
Information and friend segregation for online social networks: a user study,"Online social networks (OSNs) captured the attention of the masses by offering attractive means of sharing personal information and developing social relationships. People expose personal information about their lives on OSNs. This may result in undesirable consequences of users’ personal information leakage to an unwanted audience and raises privacy concerns. The issue of privacy has received a significant attention in both the research literature and the mainstream media. In this paper, we present results of an empirical study that measure users’ attitude towards interpersonal privacy concerns in OSNs. The results demonstrated a serious mismatch between privacy concerns of users and their information sharing behavior. In addition, it indicated that strangers are part of user social circles, this makes privacy protection more complicated, and introduce an insider threat, whereas all existing privacy tools allow users to manage the outsider threat. Information and friend segregation strategies are suggested on the basis of user information disclosure and interaction pattern. We conclude that sensitivity of information and frequency of interaction, both, play a vital role in information and friend segregation."
"The aliphatic hydrocarbon distributions of terrestrial plants around an alpine lake: a pilot study from Lake Ximencuo, Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","As part of an investigation of the sources of aliphatic hydrocarbons to the sediments of alpine Lake Ximencuo, leaves of the eight dominant vascular plants were collected and their hydrocarbon contents were analyzed. A series of unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons were identified in the plant leaves; in particular, Festuca sp. contain a series of n-alkadienes that have rarely been reported in previous studies. The comparison of n-alkane proxies (ACL27–33, ACLT, Paq, and CPI) and δ13Corg among plant leaves, surface soils, and lake sediments suggests that organic proxies have been altered to varying degrees during the transport and burial process of organic materials. It is believed that microbial reworking and source changes have great impacts on organic proxies in the alpine lake system. In addition, the cluster analysis for plant leaves depending on n-alkane compositions and the ACLT proxy generates similar results. Accordingly, we postulate that the average chain length of plant waxes might be a potential indicator of plant classification in regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau."
"Application of the momentum kick model to pbpb collisions at \(\sqrt {{s_{NN}}} \)
= 2.76 TeV at the LHC","The “ridge structure” in the Δφ-Δη correlation has been observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in AuAu collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is known that hydrodynamic models are the most successful in explaining the phenomenon. However, there has been some doubt as to whether hydrodynamic flows could be produced in small systems, such as pp collisions, enough to generate the ridge structure. This question leads us to introduce a dynamical process between particles involved in a collision event. In this process, a near-side jet, arising close to the surface, collides with medium partons and the collided particles obtain a momentum transfer along the jet direction to be the ridge particles. Now that there exist several analysis results, based on this approach, in regard to AuAu collisions at the STAR and PHENIX and pp collisions at the LHC, we extend the application to high-energy PbPb collisions at the LHC. We conclude that the kinematic description can explain the ridge behavior formed in high-energy collisions at the LHC, independent of a scale of a collision system."
A novel two-stream saliency image fusion CNN architecture for person re-identification,"Background interference, which arises from complex environment, is a critical problem for a robust person re-identification (re-ID) system. The background noise may significantly compromise the feature learning and matching process. To reduce the background interference, this paper proposes a saliency image embedding as a pedestrian descriptor. First, to eliminate the background for each pedestrian image, the saliency image is constructed, which is implemented through an unsupervised manifold ranking-based saliency detection algorithm. Second, to reduce some errors and details missing of pedestrian during the saliency image construction process, a saliency image fusion (SIF) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is well designed, in which the original pedestrian image and saliency image are both employed as input. We implement our idea in the identification models based on some state-of-the-art backbone CNN models (i.e., CaffeNet, VGGNet-16, GoogLeNet and ResNet-50). We show that the learned pedestrian descriptor by the proposed SIF CNN architecture provides a significant improvement over the baselines and produces a competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art person re-ID methods on three large-scale person re-ID benchmarks (i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MARS)."

Zakaryan, where Djrbashian’s generalized fractional integral was used to establish the descriptive representations and boundary properties of meromorphic in the unit disc functions of the classes N{ω} contained in the Nevanlinna class N of functions of bounded type. Some results of nearly the same type are obtained for several weighted classes of meromorphic in the upper half-plane functions with bounded Tsuji characteristics by application of the Laplace transform along with an Hadamard–Liouville type generalized integro-differential operator with an unbounded integration contour, which becomes the Liouville integro-differentiation in a particular case."
Uniqueness of solution for higher-order fractional differential equations with conjugate type integral conditions,"In this article, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution for some higher-order fractional differential equations with conjugate type integral conditions. The interesting point lies in that the Lipschitz constant is closely associated with the first eigenvalues corresponding to the relevant linear operator. The discussion is based on the Banach contraction map principle and the theory of u0-positive linear operator."
Lyapunov-type inequalities for a fractional p-Laplacian system,"In this paper, we establish Lyapunov-type inequalities for a fractional p-Laplacian system in an open bounded subset Ω⊂ℝN RN under Dirichlet boundary conditions. As an application of the obtained inequalities, we establish some geometric properties of the generalized spectrum associated to the considered system."
Wellposedness of Neumann boundary-value problems of space-fractional differential equations,"Fractional differential equation (FDE) provides an accurate description of transport processes that exhibit anomalous diffusion but introduces new mathematical difficulties that have not been encountered in the context of integer-order differential equation. For example, the wellposedness of the Dirichlet boundary-value problem of one-dimensional variable-coefficient FDE is not fully resolved yet. In addition, Neumann boundary-value problem of FDE poses significant challenges, partly due to the fact that different forms of FDE and different types of Neumann boundary condition have been proposed in the literature depending on different applications."
Local and global existence of mild solutions for a class of semilinear fractional integro-differential equations,"In this paper, we study a class of fractional semilinear integro-differential equations of order β ∈ (1,2] with nonlocal conditions. By using the solution operator, measure of noncompactness and some fixed point theorems, we obtain the existence of local and global mild solutions for the problem. The results presented in this paper improve and generalize many classical results. An example about fractional partial differential equations is given to show the application of our theory."
High-voltage operation of binder-free CNT supercapacitors using ionic liquid electrolytes,"High-voltage (≥4.0 V) operation of supercapacitor devices was demonstrated using carbon nanotubes as active electrode materials combined with room temperature ionic liquids as electrolyte. Pouch cells were assembled with four different ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM-BF4), diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl) ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DEME-TFSI), diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium tetrafluoroborate (DEME-BF4), and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr14-TFSI). Cyclic voltammetry showed the maximum operational voltage to be 4.5 V for DEME-TFSI and 4.7 V for DEME-BF4. Compared to electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) cells using propylene carbonate electrolyte at 2.7 V, capacitance increased by 20% using BMIM-BF4 at 4.0 V, DEME-TFSI at 4.5 V, DEME-BF4 at 4.7 V, and Pyr14-TFSI at 4.3 V, with tripling of energy density and comparable power density using Pyr14-TFSI-based EDLCs. Long-term cyclability using BMIM-BF4 ionic liquid electrolyte operating at 4.0 V showed retention of >80% of initial capacitance after 65,000 continuous cycles without doubling of initial cell equivalent series resistance."
Chinese herbal medicine TangBi Formula treatment of patients with type 2 diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and it has become a major public health problem worldwide because of its high and increasing prevalence, morbidity, and disability rate. The current medications for DSPN are not entirely satisfactory. Preliminary studies indicated that the Chinese herbal TangBi Formula may alleviate signs and symptoms and improve the velocity of nerve conduction in patients with DSPN. This study was designed to determine if Chinese herbal medicine used in combination with conventional treatment is more effective than conventional treatment alone."
Hidden diversity of Nycteribiidae (Diptera) bat flies from the Malagasy region and insights on host-parasite interactions,"We present information on Nycteribiidae flies parasitizing the bat families Pteropodidae, Miniopteridae and Vespertilionidae from the Malagasy Region, contributing insight into their diversity and host preference."
Bacterial diversity of wild-caught Lutzomyia longipalpis (a vector of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil) under distinct physiological conditions by metagenomics analysis,"The leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by protozoans of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. In the New World, Lutzomyia longipalpis is the most important vector of visceral leishmaniasis and is a proven vector for Leishmania infantum chagasi in Brazil. During development within the vector, Leishmania can interact with a variety of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. The presence of bacteria in the midgut of sand flies can influence the development and survival of the parasite."
Improving the design of a mCSCL Chinese character forming game with a distributed scaffolding design framework,"Appropriate design of collaborative learning activities for students using mobile devices can be supported by different forms of scaffolding provided by peers, by the teacher or by the technology. Building on prior studies in mCSCL (mobile computer-supported collaborative learning), we developed Chinese-PP, a novel in-class mobile synchronous collaborative learning game for constructing Chinese characters from components, with the unique characteristic of spontaneous small group formations. In this paper, we propose a distributed scaffolding design framework to guide us in examining and refining/revising the interplay among various forms of scaffolding in the learning model across various design-based research (DBR) cycles of our study on Chinese-PP in a primary school in Singapore. We believe a generalized scaffolding design framework has the potential to inform technology-enhanced learning research with a structure to support the iterative process of enacting and redesigning the socio-techno-pedagogical frameworks developed by individual research projects."
Investigating the bunkering choice determinants: the case of the port of Antwerp,"From a European, regional and local perspective, as well as from the perspective of port authorities, it is important that waterborne transport becomes sustainable. As possible solutions to comply with new types of legislation (SECA-zones), shipping companies consider amongst others the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and low sulphur fuel. An important aspect in the choice of fuel are the current bunker strategies of the shipping companies."
Prognostic values of the integrated model incorporating the volume of metastatic regional cervical lymph node and pretreatment serum Epstein–Barr virus DNA copy number in predicting distant metastasis in patients with N1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"According to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, over 50% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have N1 disease at initial diagnosis. However, patients with N1 NPC are relatively under-researched, and the metastasis risk of this group is not well-stratified. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic values of gross tumor volume of metastatic regional lymph node (GTVnd) and pretreatment serum copy number of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) DNA in predicting distant metastasis of patients with N1 NPC, and to develop an integrated prognostic model that incorporates GTVnd and EBV DNA copy number for this group of patients."
The role of individuals’ risk representations in risk management - case-study on lahars in Arequipa (Peru),"In risk-prone areas, measuring risk representation can help implementing communication and disclosing information among the population, in order to increase individual initiatives to protect themselves and their properties or to provide a better knowledge of the appropriate measures to be adopted during or after a disaster. The perceived legitimacy of authorities disclosing information is a key issue in individuals’ beliefs. Then, to compel the population to follow the authorities’ recommendations and to adopt the suitable behaviour in case of a disaster, the information needs to be targeted, in order to take into account (a) the individuals’ representation of the risk they incur and (b) the level of legitimacy received from the authorities in charge of risk management. Consequently, the question of the modalities to qualify the relations between information and representation and risk management arises?"
"An unexpected record of an African mangrove crab, Perisesarma alberti Rathbun, 1921, (Decapoda: Brachyura: Sesarmidae) in European waters","Finding of a single female specimen of the African mangrove crab Perisesarma alberti Rathbun, Bull Am Mus Nat Hist 43: 379–474, 1921, in the intertidal zone of the eastern part of the Bay of Seine, English Channel, France."
"Ring-core method in determining the amount of non-uniform residual stress in laminated composites: experimental, finite element and theoretical evaluation","Residual stresses in composite constructions are created because of non-uniform contraction of layers during cooling from curing to ambient temperature. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of incremental ring-core method to estimate non-uniform residual stresses in various laminates of polymer matrix composites. To carry out this test, glass/epoxy specimens were selected in two different types of symmetric cross-ply laminate \(\left( \left[ 0^{\circ }_{4}/90^{\circ }_{4}\right] _{S}\right) \) and symmetric quasi-isotropic laminate \(\left( \left[ 0^{\circ }_{2}/\pm 45^{\circ }/90^{\circ }_{2}\right] _{S}\right) \). The samples were created using hand layup and vacuum bagging. By experimental tests, released strains measured during milling process and coefficient factors for every annular groove machining operations were obtained by finite element modeling. As well, residual stresses were calculated by classical lamination plate theory. For symmetric cross-ply, the maximum difference between experimental and theoretical results was about 16%, which was observed in the first and eighth layers. Symmetric quasi-isotropic specimen showed also good agreement between the results and the maximum measurement error of 8% was observed. For the mentioned two cases, summation of components of the residual stress in all directions is near to zero. The results of this study show that in the ring-core method, because of the nature and higher volume of material removal than other methods, values of residual stress released are higher and the results have a good consistency compared with the theoretical values."
Time series analysis for C2C conversion rate,"The rise of online shopping by individuals in recent years has made e-commerce a crucial topic of interest in research and practice. The critical question in this domain is the extent to which online visits convert into purchases. Researchers have proposed decision models to predict consumer conversion behavior that primarily uses click-stream data, path data, panel data, and log data. This paper proposes an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based ensemble recognition method for conversion rate (EMDER) to explore the potential pattern, business cycles in time series for conversion rate. EMDER builds on some notions, such as the database of candidate factors time series , recognition function, the recognized factor database, cycle function, and residue-trend recognition function. We collect 50 datasets from Taobao.com and find a seasonal pattern, Index of Clothing Consumer Price pattern and the long-term time series pattern with monthly data. For the daily analysis, we discover patterns in the calendar of daily fluctuation, the hesitation window, the consumers’ cash flow determined pattern, the promotion day and holiday influence. A comparison between EMD and Wavelet-based method is conducted, which reveals EMD outperforms the Wavelet-based model in the deposition quality and do not have the model-selection problem. The data analysis results provide support for the proposed method, which indicates that our model enables managers to analyze online consumer purchasing behavior by a new easy approaching way, which is time series of conversion rate."
Shame and Shamelessness,"What is the relation between shame and shamelessness? It may seem obvious: shamelessness is simply the absence of shame. But on reflection, it becomes clear that the story is considerably more complicated. Michelle Mason's intriguing ""On Shamelessness"" prompts such reflection (albeit unintentionally). Mason argues that we should be mindful of the ""moral importance of shame"" and ""unapologetic in its defense"" (403), and she does so via an examination of shamelessness and an argument to the effect that shamelessness is (with some exceptions) a moral fault. The tacit assumption is that insofar as shamelessness is a moral fault, the value of shame is vindicated. I challenge that assumption."
The SEEA-Based Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling Framework: An Illustration with Guatemala’s Forest and Fuelwood Sector,"This paper develops and operationalizes the integrated economic-environmental modelling (IEEM) platform which integrates environmental data organized under the first international system of environmental economic accounting with a powerful dynamic economy-wide modelling approach. IEEM enables the ex-ante economic analysis of policies on the economy and the environment in a quantitative, comprehensive and consistent framework. IEEM elucidates the two-way interrelationships between the economy and environment, considering how economic activities depend on the environment as a source of inputs and as a sink for their outputs. In addition to standard economic impact indicators such as gross domestic product, income and employment, IEEM generates indicators that describe policy impacts on the use of environmental resources, wealth and environmental quality which together determine prospects for future economic growth and well-being. To illustrate the analytical capabilities of IEEM, the model is calibrated with Guatemala’s SEEA and applied to analysis of its forest and fuelwood sector where negative health and environmental impacts arise from inefficient fuelwood use."

On Educating While Hoping for the Impossible: Gabriel Marcel’s Absolute Hope as a Rejection of Educational Instrumentalism,"Over the last 20 years, there has been an increase in philosophical inquiries of hope both in philosophy of mind and of virtue as well as in the philosophy of education. This paper wishes to add to this discussion by presenting the analysis of hope by French existentialist philosopher and theologian Gabriel Marcel and examining its possible contribution to educational practices and beliefs. As one of the very few modern, systematic accounts of hope, Marcel’s provocative conception of it and his critique of its common “technical” use could prove promising when applied to educational theory and practice. Following Marcel, I argue that in hope we find a complex and possibly contradictory view of the future: as a result of planning and technical problem-solving on one hand, and on the other, as an inclination towards the mysterious and radically unexpected. I suggest that maintaining educational hope within the tension between the planned and the unexpected, and specifically rejecting a complete disenchantment of the educational act, could help in securing education from being reduced to instrumental training and socializing, opening it up to new and unimaginable possibilities."
Is dry soil planting an adaptation strategy for maize cultivation in semi-arid Tanzania?,"Agriculture has the greatest potential to lift the African continent out of poverty and alleviate hunger. Among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania has an abundance of natural resources and major agricultural potential. However, one of the most important constraints facing Tanzania’s agricultural sector is the dependence on unreliable and irregular weather, including rainfall. A strategy to cope with climate uncertainty in semi-arid regions is to proceed with the sowing of the crop before the onset of the rainy season. The advantage is that when the rains start, seeds are already in the soil and can begin immediately the process of germination. The objective of this paper was to assess the effectiveness of dry-soil planting for maize as an adaptation strategy in the context of a changing climate in Dodoma, a semi-arid region in Tanzania. For this assessment, the DSSAT crop model was used in combination with climate scenarios based on representative concentration pathways. A probability of crop failure of more than 80% can be expected when sowing occurs during the planting window (of 21 days) starting on 1st November. The next planting window we assessed, starting on 23rd November (which was still before the onset of rain), presented significantly lower probabilities of crop failure, indicating that sowing before the onset of the rainy season is a suitable adaptation strategy. Results also indicated that, despite not reaching the highest maize grain yields, fields prepared for dry-soil planting still produced adequate yields. The cultivation of several fields using the dry planting method is a strategy farmers can use to cope with low rainfall conditions, since it increases the chances of harvesting at least some of the cultivated fields. We conclude that dry-soil planting is a feasible and valid technique, even in scenarios of climate change, in order to provide acceptable maize yields in semi-arid Tanzania."
Functional Compromise Cohort Study (FCCS): Sarcopenia is a Strong Predictor of Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit,"Functional compromise in elderly patients is considered to be a significant contributing factor in increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. It is described as a state of reduced physiologic reserves including, e.g., sarcopenia, cachexia, malnutrition and frailty with increased susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. Aim of this study was to investigate the association of sarcopenia with mortality in ICU patients."
The Effect of Intraoperative Nefopam Administration on Acute Postoperative Pain and Chronic Discomfort After Robotic or Endoscopic Assisted Thyroidectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Acute postoperative pain and chronic discomfort are reported after robotic or endoscopic thyroidectomy. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, and double-blinded clinical trial was to investigate whether intraoperative infusion of nefopam decreases acute postoperative pain and chronic discomfort following either a robotic or endoscopic thyroidectomy via the bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA)."
Random permutation principal component analysis for cancelable biometric recognition,"Although biometrics is being increasingly used across the world, it also raises concerns over privacy and security of the enrolled identities. This is due to the fact that biometrics are not cancelable and if compromised may give access to the intruder. To address these problems, in this paper, we suggest two simple and powerful techniques called (i) Random Permutation Principal Component Analysis (RP-PCA) and (ii) Random Permutation Two Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (RP-2DPCA). The proposed techniques are based on the idea of cancelable biometric which can be reissued if compromised. The proposed techniques work in a cryptic manner by accepting the cancelable biometric template and a key (called PIN) issued to a user. The identity of a person is recognized only if the combination of template and PIN is valid, otherwise the identity is rejected. The superiority of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on three freely available face (ORL), iris (UBIRIS) and ear (IITD) datasets against state-of-the-art methods. The key advantages of the proposed techniques are (i) classification accuracy remains unaffected due to cancelable biometric templates generated using random permutation (ii) robustness across different biometrics. In addition, no image registration is required for performing recognition."
A Model for Pollen Measurement Using Video Monitoring of Honey Bees,"This paper introduces a novel approach using video monitoring to automatically count pollen sacs on honey bees returning to a beehive. This allows beekeepers to have an estimate of the food storage situation in a beehive without having to visit and open the hive. Pollen sac detection is a challenge because the full sacs are very small and they often have a similar colour to the bee’s body. The first step is to detect bees on the video and track the bees for pollen counting. The bees are detected using their colour and motion, and tracked using a Kalman filter and the Hough transform. The second step is to detect pollen sacs on each individual detected bee image. On each individual bee image, a bee blob is created and image moments are used to remove an elliptical shape from the blob, which includes the bee’s main body parts (head, abdomen and tail). The pollen sacs are then detected in the remainder of the blob using colour thresholding. The outcome includes pollen blobs and other blobs that are similar to pollen blobs (non-pollen blobs). The pollen sacs have two features that can be used for object discrimination. The receiver operating characteristic is used to calculate the threshold for pollen discrimination using these two features. Finally, the bee tracking model is combined with the pollen sac detection to count the number of bees carrying pollen on the monitoring video."
Validation of a three-dimensional body scanner for body composition measures,"The accuracy of an infrared three-dimensional (3D) body scanner in determining body composition was compared against hydrostatic weighing (HW), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and anthropometry. A total of 265 adults (119 males; age = 22.1 ± 2.5 years; body mass index = 24.5 ± 3.9 kg/m2) had their body fat percent (BF%) estimated from 3D scanning, HW, BIA, skinfolds, and girths. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences among methods (p < 0.001). Multivariate ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of sex and method (p < 0.001), with a non-significant interaction (p = 0.101). Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons identified that BF% from 3D scanning (18.1 ± 7.8%) was significantly less than HW (22.8 ± 8.5%, p < 0.001), BIA (20.1 ± 9.1%, p < 0.001), skinfolds (19.7 ± 9.7%, p < 0.001), and girths (21.2 ± 10.4%, p < 0.001). The 3D scanner decreased in precision with increasing adiposity, potentially resulting from inconsistences in the 3D scanner’s analysis algorithm. A correction factor within the algorithm is required before infrared 3D scanning can be considered valid in measuring BF%."
Diminished expression of β2-GPI is associated with a reduced ability to mitigate complement activation in anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated immune thrombocytopenia,"Anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated complement activation has been reported to be important in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, the role of the complement system and the involved regulatory mechanism remain equivocal. Beta2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI), known as the main target for antiphospholipid autoantibodies, has been demonstrated as a complement regulator. Here, we investigated the complement-regulatory role of β2-GPI in anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated ITP. Plasma complement activation and enhanced complement activation capacity (CAC) were found in ITP patients with anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies in vivo and in vitro. Diminished plasma levels of β2-GPI were shown in patients of this group, which was inversely correlated with C5b-9 deposition. C5b-9 generation was inhibited by approximate physiological concentrations of β2-GPI, in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of C3a generation by β2-GPI and the existence of β2-GPI/C3 complexes in plasma indicated a regulation on the level of the C3 convertase. Furthermore, β2-GPI down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and cleavage of BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) and ultimately harbored platelet lysis. Our findings may provide a novel link between diminished plasma levels of β2-GPI and enhanced complement activation, indicating β2-GPI as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated ITP."
Effects of dried tofu supplementation during interval walking training on the methylation of the NFKB2 gene in the whole blood of older women,"Muscle atrophy with aging is closely associated with chronic systemic inflammation and lifestyle-related diseases. Here, we assessed whether dried tofu intake during 5-month interval walking training (IWT) enhanced increases in thigh muscle mass and strength and ameliorated susceptibility to inflammation in older women. Subjects (n = 32, ~ 65 years) who performed IWT for > 6 months participated in this study. They were randomly divided into 2 groups: IWT + placebo intake (PLG, n = 16; 108 kcal, 0.2 g protein, 5.5 g fat, and 14.4 g carbohydrate) and IWT + dried tofu intake (DTG, n = 16; 111 kcal, 9.6 g protein, 6.0 g fat, and 4.6 g carbohydrate). They were instructed to repeat ≥ 5 sets of fast and slow walking for 3 min each at ≥ 70 and 40% peak aerobic capacity for walking, respectively, per day for ≥ 4 days/week. Immediately after daily exercise, subjects were instructed to consume the supplements assigned to each group. In the DTG, after IWT, the methylation increased at 4/6 sites in the promoter region of the NFKB2 gene in the whole blood (all, P < 0.04), with an 18% increase in the average methylation of the 6 sites (P = 0.035). On the other hand, in the PLG, the increase occurred at only 2/6 sites, with no significant increase in the average methylation of the 6 sites. No significant differences were observed in increases in thigh muscle strength or cross-sectional area between the groups (all, P > 0.2). Altogether, dried tofu supplementation during IWT likely enhanced the methylation of the NFKB2 gene more than IWT alone, without detectably enhanced increases in thigh muscle strength or cross-sectional area."
Higher phylogenetic diversity prevents loss of functional diversity caused by successive drying and rewetting cycles,"Microbial communities regulate nutrient cycling in soil, thus the impact of climate change on the structure and function of these communities can cause an imbalance of nutrients in the environment. Structural and functional changes of soil bacterial communities in two contrasting biomes in Brazil, the Atlantic Forest and the Tropical Dry Forest (Caatinga), were studied by simulating, in microcosms, rainfall and drought events. Soil samples were collected in three Brazilian states: Bahia, Pernambuco and São Paulo, in a total of four sampling sites. Analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon libraries revealed changes in microbial communities after three drying-rewetting cycles (60–30% water holding capacity). Alpha diversity indexes were obtained for bacterial communities, as well as the functional diversity index (Shannon) based on the activity of the following enzymes: acid and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, dehydrogenase, cellulase, amylase, urease and phytase. In general, the soils of Caatinga showed a decrease in the diversity indexes studied, conversely, however, the soils of Atlantic Forest were found to be more resistant during the drying-rewetting cycles. Functional diversity was significantly different for the two biomes, with a decrease in Caatinga soils, while Atlantic Forest samples demonstrated a greater stability of enzymatic activity. Further, the Atlantic Forest samples showed more resistance when compared to samples from Caatinga. The results found in this study have confirmed the hypothesis that biomes, independent of climate, when subjected to successive events of drought and rewetting exhibit structural and metabolic changes."
Genome sequence and comparative analysis of Jiangella alba YIM 61503T isolated from a medicinal plant Maytenus austroyunnanensis,"A draft genome sequence of Jiangella alba YIM 61503T revealed a genome size of 7,664,864 bp arranged in 33 scaffolds. The genome was predicted to contain 7196 predicted genes, including 51 coding for RNA. Phylogenetic and comparative analyses of the draft genome of J. alba YIM 61503T with the available genomes of other Jiangella species suggested a proximal similarity between strains J. alba YIM 61503T and J. muralis DSM 45357T, while indicating a high divergence between J. gansuensis YIM 002T and other Jiangella species. The genome of J. alba YIM 61503T also revealed genes involved in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis and an alkylresorcinols gene cluster. Further, detection of phosphotransferase genes in the genome of all Jiangella species indicated that they can uptake and phosphorylate sugars. The presences of TreX-Z, TreS and OtsA-OtsB genes in some of the Jiangella strains also indicated a possible mechanism for their tolerance of high salinity. Besides providing new insights into its genetic features, our results suggested that J. alba YIM 61503T could be a potential strain for further genome mining studies. The release of this genome may, therefore, provide a better prospect for understanding “evolutionary taxonomy” about this genus in future."
"Muscle lysyl oxidase activity and structural/thermal properties of highly cross-linked collagen in jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) mantle, fins and arms","Muscle from mantle, fins and arms of squid (Dosidicus gigas) were compared based on lysyl oxidase activity (LOX), chemical/structural and thermodynamic properties of highly cross-linked collagen. The arms collagen presented the highest temperature (Tp) and enthalpy of transition. The arms collagen thermic properties may be explained by the higher imino amino acid content, proline and lysine hydroxylation degrees. Moreover, among the regions, the collagen from the arms had a more intense β band chain, hydroxymerodesmosine peak in the resonance magnetic nuclear spectra and pyridinoline peak in the Raman spectra. Fins showed the highest LOX activity. The LOX activity was associated with the Tp, proline and lysine hydroxylation degrees. These results implied that the collagen in the arms was more intermolecularly ordered than the mantle and fins, and may provide a theoretical basis for a better understanding of the thermal behaviour of squid tissues during management and processing."
Assessment of cardiovascular risk profile based on measurement of tophus volume in patients with gout,"Hyperuricemia and gout are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation of total tophus volumes, measured using dual-energy computed tomography, with cardiovascular risk and the presence of metabolic syndrome. Dual-energy computed tomography datasets from 91 patients with a diagnosis of gout were analyzed retrospectively. Patients who received urate lowering therapy were excluded to avoid the effect on tophus volume. The total volumes of tophaceous deposition were quantified using automated volume assessment software. The 10-year cardiovascular risk using the Framingham Risk Score and metabolic syndrome based on the Third Adult Treatment Panel criteria were estimated. Fifty-five and 36 patients with positive and negative dual-energy computed tomography results, respectively, were assessed. Patients with positive dual-energy computed tomography results showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, compared with those with negative dual-energy computed tomography results. The total tophus volumes were significantly correlated with the Framingham Risk Score, and the number of metabolic syndrome components (r = 0.22 and p = 0.036 and r = 0.373 and p < 0.001, respectively). The total tophus volume was one of the independent prognostic factors for the Framingham Risk Score in a multivariate analysis. This study showed the correlation of total tophus volumes with cardiovascular risk and metabolic syndrome-related comorbidities. A high urate burden could affect unfavorable cardiovascular profiles."
The influence of the availability of visual cues on the accurate perception of spatial dimensions in architectural virtual environments,"Several authors have observed that spatial dimensions tend to be underestimated in virtual environments. In this study, we hypothesize that the availability of visual cues in virtual environments has an influence on the accuracy of perception. An experiment was conducted to compare spatial perception in real and virtual environments that were modeled differently and visualized using a head-mounted display. Results suggest that the greater the availability of visual cues, the greater the level of accuracy in the estimates, especially for egocentric dimensions (p < 0.001). In the end, this study contributes to a better understanding of how architectural virtual environments should be modeled for use in professional or commercial applications where accurate and reliable simulations are required."
Test for model selection using Cramér–von Mises distance in a fixed design regression setting,"In this paper a test for model selection is proposed which extends the usual goodness-of-fit test in several ways. It is assumed that the underlying distribution H depends on a covariate value in a fixed design setting. Secondly, instead of one parametric class we consider two competing classes one of which may contain the underlying distribution. The test allows to select one of two equally treated model classes which fits the underlying distribution better. To define the distance of distributions various measures are available. Here the Cramér-von Mises has been chosen. The null hypothesis that both parametric classes have the same distance to the underlying distribution H can be checked by means of a test statistic, the asymptotic properties of which are shown under a set of suitable conditions. The performance of the test is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the procedure is applied to a data set from an endurance test on electric motors."
Examining the utility of national indicators of relative age disadvantage in Europe,"We introduce new indicators measuring relative age disadvantage of older compared with younger people at a national level. Drawing on data from 29 European countries, the study demonstrates that there is no consistent relative old age disadvantage with regard to the four indicators selected: satisfaction in life, perceived prejudice, perceived access to health services, and subjective income. Relative age disadvantages (i.e. the status of those aged 30–45 divided by the status of older adults aged 60–75) correlated negatively with overall levels of happiness at the country level. Multi-level analyses revealed cross-level interactions, indicating that countries with higher levels of relative age disadvantage were characterized by a more negative relation between age and happiness at the individual level. Our findings highlight a need to further investigate relative age disadvantages for understanding, describing, and potentially changing the situation of older people in modern societies."
Physical Forces Modulate Oxidative Status and Stress Defense Meditated Metabolic Adaptation of Yeast Colonies: Spaceflight and Microgravity Simulations,"Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation."
Content and alignment of state writing standards and assessments as predictors of student writing achievement: an analysis of 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress data,"We examined the degree to which content of states’ writing standards and assessments (using measures of content range, frequency, balance, and cognitive complexity) and their alignment were related to student writing achievement on the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), while controlling for student, school, and state characteristics.
 We found student demographic characteristics had the largest effect on between-state differences in writing performance, followed by state policy-related variables, then state and school covariates. States with writing tests that exhibited greater alignment with the NAEP writing assessment demonstrated significantly higher writing scores. We discuss plausible implications of these findings."
Effect of water and methanol in the production of methyl methacrylate over iron phosphate catalysts,"This work discusses two production routes to methyl methacrylate (MMA) over an iron phosphate catalyst, namely oxidative dehydrogenation of methyl isobutyrate (MIB) and isobutyric acid (IBA) with methanol as co-feed. In situ studies show that at 400 °C, a mixture of the iron tridymite and quartz like phases are present under air, H2 and N2. The catalyst was tested in a fixed bed stainless steel reactor. The feed was passed over the catalyst with air and methanol; and air, water and methanol. The effects of the water to feed ratio and methanol to feed ratio were studied in terms of maximum conversion, yield and selectivity to MMA. Using methyl isobutyrate as a feed and methanol as a co-feed, the best yield of methylmethacrylate obtained was 40%. This corresponds to a selectivity of 73%, at a conversion of 55%. Feeding isobutyric acid and methanol over the iron phosphate catalyst gave an optimum yield of 15% methyl methacrylate at 400 °C. The yield of the products increased with increasing methanol/IBA ratio due to methanol limiting the hydrolysis reactions. The results obtained in this study show that MMA can be formed by the oxidative dehydrogenation–esterification of IBA and methanol over the iron phosphate catalyst."
Quality of life at 6 years after occupational injury,"Occupational injuries have considerable impact on workers’ lives. However, data regarding workers’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at several years after the injury are lacking. This study assessed workers’ HRQOL at 6 years after occupational injury and determined related factors in each HRQOL domain."
Relation between Credit Default Swap Spreads and Stock Prices: A Non-linear Perspective,"In this study, we investigate the relation between credit risk, as implied in the credit default swaps (CDS), and market prices of Markit iTraxx Europe index companies. To test the hypothesis of co-integration between CDS and stock prices, we apply linear and non-linear models that allow for structural breaks. Using Johansen trace test of cointegration for a set of 109 pairs of CDS and stock prices of the companies included in the index, over the period of January 2012 to January 2016, we find that at the 10% level of significance, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected for 26 pairs. We extend our analysis by allowing for a one-time structural break with unknown timing. Using alternative cointegration tests, we find that CDS and stock prices are cointegrated. More specifically, there are 47 companies in our sample for which CDS spreads and stock prices are cointegrated at the 10% level of significance. The existence of a long-run relation between CDS and stock prices of the European investment-grade companies is evidence for a possible transmission of shocks between the two segments of the financial market – the credit market (via CDS) and the stock market."
Numerical Comparison of Nasal Aerosol Administration Systems for Efficient Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery,Nose-to-brain drug administration along the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways offers an alternative route for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The characterization of particle deposition remains difficult to achieve in experiments. Alternative numerical approach is applied to identify suitable aerosol particle size with maximized inhaled doses.
"Biomass, activity and structure of rhizosphere soil microbial community under different metallophytes in a mining site",Microbial properties are often used to assess the recovery of soil health during phytoremediation. A field survey was conducted to test the effects of different plant metallophytes (excluder and hyperaccumulator) on soil microbial characteristics.
"Biogenic synthesis from Prunus × yedoensis leaf extract, characterization, and photocatalytic and antibacterial activity of TiO2 nanoparticles","Green synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) from Prunus × yedoensis leaf extract (PYLE), and their application for removal of phosphate and their antibacterial activity, were studied for the first time. NPs were obtained using a green chemistry approach from 0.1 M TiO2 and PYLE at ratio of 1:1 (v/w). Initial confirmation of production of TiO2 NPs was provided by a color change from white to light yellow, then calcination was performed at 500 °C for 1 h. The TiO2 NPs were characterized using various analytical techniques such as ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the optimal amount of TiO2 NPs for removal of phosphate was 10 mg/l (10 ppm) with duration of 25 min. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of TiO2 NPs was also investigated using two different bacteria (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli) in aqueous medium. The results revealed highly efficient sunlight-driven photocatalytic and antibacterial activity of TiO2 NPs."
Exposure of pregnant sows to deoxynivalenol during 35–70 days of gestation does not affect pathomorphological and immunohistochemical properties of fetal organs,"In order to evaluate the influence of deoxynivalenol (DON) on histomorphological and immunohistochemical parameters in the development of porcine fetuses, five pregnant sows were fed a control diet (0.15 mg DON/kg diet) and seven sows a contaminated diet (4.42 mg DON/kg diet) between days 35 and 70 of gestation. On day 70, fetuses were delivered by caesarean section and sows and fetuses were euthanized. Tissue samples of three fetuses from each sow were collected, fixed in formalin, and processed routinely for light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. At necropsy, no macroscopic lesions were observed in any organ of the fetuses. Histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and morphometrical parameters of the immune system, liver, and intestinal tract were examined. The following antibodies were used in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, gut, and bone marrow to compare control- and DON-treated animals: (I) CD3 and CD79a (T and B lymphocytes differentiation); (II) myeloid/histiocyte antigen 387 (MAC) (identification of macrophages); (III) Ki-67 Antigen (Ki-67) (proliferation marker); (IV) p-p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-p38 MAPK) as well as caspase-3 (cas3) and caspase-9 (cas9) (enzymes of apoptosis cascade); (V) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) (immune-related protein). The results of the study show that exposure of pregnant sows with DON between gestation days 35 and 70 causes no pathomorphologically or immunohistochemically detectable alterations in all fetal organs examined."
Flirting with the enemy: online competitor referral and entry-deterrence,"Internet retailers often compete fiercely for consumers through expensive marketing efforts like search engine advertising, online coupons and a variety of special deals. Against this background, it is somewhat puzzling that many online retailers have recently begun referring their website visitors to their direct competitors. In this paper, using an analytical model, we examine this counterintuitive practice and posit that an entry deterrence motive can potentially explain this marketplace puzzle. Specifically, we develop a model where two incumbents compete for consumers” business while facing a potential entrant who is deciding whether to enter the market. In addition to setting the price, each incumbent firm could potentially display a referral link to its direct competitor. Our analysis reveals that when confronted with a potential entry, an incumbent may refer consumers to its competitor, intensifying the market competition that could result in shutting off the entrant. Furthermore, we show that when referral efficiency is exogenous, it is possible that in equilibrium only one incumbent refers its customers to competitor (i.e., one-way referral) or both incumbents refer their customers to each other (i.e, two-way referral). When referral efficiency is endogenous, the ex-ante symmetric incumbents may choose asymmetric referral efficiencies ex-post. We extend the model in a number of directions including making the entrant share endogenous and allowing incumbents to be asymmetric. Overall, our results indicate that firms may be motivated by entry deterrence to voluntarily refer consumers to their direct competitors even when they are paid nothing for the referral."
Aggregation of consumer ratings: an application to Yelp.com,"Because consumer reviews leverage the wisdom of the crowd, the way in which they are aggregated is a central decision faced by platforms. We explore this “rating aggregation problem” and offer a structural approach to solving it, allowing for (1) reviewers to vary in stringency and accuracy, (2) reviewers to be influenced by existing reviews, and (3) product quality to change over time. Applying this to restaurant reviews from Yelp.com, we construct an adjusted average rating and show that even a simple algorithm can lead to large information efficiency gains relative to the arithmetic average."
Rapid Screening of Potato Cultivars Tolerant to Nitrogen Deficiency Using a Hydroponic System,"Increased cultivar tolerance to nitrogen (N) deficiency may increase productivity and reduce environmental impact of potato crops. In this study we screened 20 cultivars for the tolerance to N-deficient (0.05 mM nitrate) in comparison with N-abundant (7.5 mM nitrate) nitrate supply using plantlets grown for 15 days in a recirculating hydroponic system. Nitrogen deficiency increased the root-to-shoot ratio in 18 cultivars. Plant total dry weight (TDW) was reduced by an average of 61% under N-deficient nitrate supply. Tolerance to N deficiency was assessed as the TDW ratio (TDWR), calculated as the ratio of TDW under N-deficient to N-abundant nitrate supply. The cultivars Norland, Raritan, Nipigon and Langlade were significantly more tolerant to nitrogen deficiency (greater TDWR) than Eramosa, Carleton, and Epicure. The results indicate that the hydroponic system has capacity to rapidly screen a large number of cultivars for tolerance to N deficiency."
Unconditionally secure multi-party quantum commitment scheme,"A new unconditionally secure multi-party quantum commitment is proposed in this paper by encoding the committed message to the phase of a quantum state. Multi-party means that there are more than one recipient in our scheme. We show that our quantum commitment scheme is unconditional hiding and binding, and hiding is perfect. Our technique is based on the interference of phase-encoded coherent states of light. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning theorem of quantum theory and the properties of quantum information."
"Hydrochemical, isotopic, and reservoir characterization of the Pasinler (Erzurum) geothermal field, eastern Turkey","The reservoir temperature and conceptual model of the Pasinler geothermal area, which is one of the most important geothermal areas in Eastern Anatolia, are determined by considering its hydrogeochemical and isotope properties. The geothermal waters have a temperature of 51 °C in the geothermal wells and are of Na–Cl–HCO3 type. The isotope contents of geothermal waters indicate that they are of meteoric origin and that they recharge on higher elevations than cold waters. The geothermal waters are of immature water class and their reservoir temperatures are calculated as 122–155 °C, and their cold water mixture rate is calculated as 32%. According to the δ13CVPDB values, the carbon in the geothermal waters originated from the dissolved carbon in the groundwaters and mantle-based CO2 gases. According to the δ34SCDT values, the sources of sulfur in the geothermal waters are volcanic sulfur, oil and coal, and limestones. The sources of the major ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, and HCO3
−) in the geothermal waters are ion exchange and plagioclase and silicate weathering. It is determined that the volcanic rocks in the area have effects on the water chemistry and elements like Zn, Rb, Sr, and Ba originated from the rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, and basalts. The rare earth element (REE) content of the geothermal waters is low, and according to the normalized REE diagrams, the light REE are getting depleted and heavy REE are getting enriched. The positive Eu and negative Ce anomalies of waters indicate oxygen-rich environments."
Accuracy assessment of noise mapping on the main street,"Among the sounds constituting a part of our daily lives, the undesired and disturbing ones are named noise. The noises can be defined as the acoustic energy that affects the physiological and psychological welfare of humans due to its direct or indirect effects on the human health. But, the traffic noise, which is one of the disturbing noises having wide dispersion in urban areas, affects the health of a gradually increasing number of people. The number of studies on measurement, dispersion, and mapping of traffic noise in developed and developing countries is gradually increasing. It can be seen that the studies concentrate on mapping based on the city centers and neighborhoods, where the traffic is intense. In this article, unlike the regional noise measurement studies, the transversal cross sections were established with a certain interval according to the land status along the main street, and the noise measurement points were determined using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The daily mean noise levels (Lden) were calculated by performing the measurements at daytime, evening, and nighttime. Using ArcGIS 10.4 software, the accuracy of noise maps created via inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical analysis interpolation methods and the dispersion effect of traffic noise were compared. According to the visual method and error corrections, it was found that the best noise map was obtained using the RBF method. It is believed that the map provides accurate and reliable results because of the flat land surface, higher noise values measured on the road region, decrease in the noise at the points farther from the road region, and soft transitions between the noise values depending on the distance from the road. In order to take measures in order to decrease or eliminate noise on the main street, the local administrators and decision-makers can make use of these maps, the accuracy of which has been confirmed."
Compressed Sensing Based Recursive Estimation of Doubly-Selective Channels for High-Mobility OFDM Systems,"For an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system in high-mobility applications, channel suffers from both frequency-selective and time-selective fading introduced by Doppler shift. Large pilot overhead is needed to estimate the numerous parameters of doubly-selective channel, resulting in low-spectral efficiency. In this paper, considering the correlation of practical wireless channels in high-dimensional signal spaces, a recursive channel estimation scheme based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed for high-mobility OFDM systems to reduce the pilot overhead. Specifically, by exploiting the sparsity of OFDM channel in basis expansion model (BEM), the sparse BEM coefficients is estimated instead of numerous channel taps. Then we theoretically verify that the BEM coefficients corresponding successive OFDM symbols also share a common support. To utilize this temporal correlation of BEM coefficients, a recursive channel estimation algorithm derived from the classical modified CS algorithm is proposed to improve the present estimation by prior channel information from previous estimation. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed recursive channel estimation scheme preforms better than conventional schemes in various scenarios, even with less pilot overhead."
Iterative Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for OFDM System in Double Selective Channels,"Intercarrier interference caused by fast time-varying multipath fading channels degrades the system performance of high-mobility orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. This study considers the challenging problem of joint channel estimation and signal detection in high mobility environments. The estimation method is based on a pilot-aided linear approximation channel modeling and iterative process. After each iteration, the channel estimates are refined with the fed-back detection signal. The channel is re-estimated iteratively, detected increasingly reliable signals. The proposed method is independent of the Doppler-spectrum, delay-profile shape and the number of paths. Numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed method is highly robust to fast time-varying multipath fading channels."
Numerical Simulation Model of Mining-Induced Fault Reactivation,"Computer simulation technology is more and more used in engineering. The simulation quality is directly related to the model used in the numerical calculation. The more model matches, the more realistic simulation results. Based on the double-sided shear test, a model of fault rock was proposed to describe the nonlinear characteristics of the surrounding rock during fault slip, the displacement evolution and stress drop of the surrounding rock during different loading stages were obtained. The model was applied in computer numerical simulation to discuss the law of fault rock activity. Simulation results show that, the destabilizing sliding process had two stages, deformation accumulation and abrupt dislocation. The deformation accumulation stage can be divided into three subprocesses: decelerating sliding, steady sliding, and accelerating sliding. When friction is added to a modified Kelvin model, which introduced a nonlinear hardening function and considered nonlinear damage in the accelerating sliding phase, the model produces a stress drop when the friction threshold is reached, so as to describe the characteristics of displacement of the fault rock, which can provide a theoretical basis for the study of fault slip instability mechanisms and deformation characteristics."
Unveilingsources of stripe rust resistance in diverse wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.) germplasm using narrow down methodology: a proof of concept,"Stripe rust of wheat caused by the fungal pathogen is a destructive foliar disease of wheat. Thus, it is crucial step to characterize the resistant germplasm for stripe rust in a diverse germplasm pool for their ultimate utilization in efficient crop rust resistance breeding. In the present study, we followed two pronged strategies involving integrated phenotypic and molecular characterization of 440 diverse wheat germplasm lines for rust resistance. The germplasm panel was extensively evaluated in field epiphytotic conditions during two consecutive years. After rigorous screening, 72 accessions were successfully revealed as resistant to moderately resistant to stripe rust. Subsequently, entries were then evaluated for their field agronomicperformances, considering prerequisites for serving as a donor germplasm,particularly for yield and 33 potential rust-resistant accessions were identified. Furthermore, to detect the sources of resistance, accessions were molecular characterized for potential race-specific resistance genes Yr5, Yr10,Yr15, and effective adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr34/Yr18/pm38. We identified the 22 accessions possessing one or more single resistance genes and two accessions were observed with at least three of them. Moreover, Lr34/Yr18/pm38 was determined to confer resistance when observed along with any of the race-specific genes. Thus, the study not only provides proof of concept methodology to identify candidate resistant sources from large germplasm collections but simultaneouslyconfirmed the contribution of combining race-specific andnon-specific APR genes. The finding could further assist in the potential deployment of resistant genes directly into the stripe rust breeding program by involving marker-assisted approaches."
Geospatial delineation of South Korea for adjusted barley cultivation under changing climate,"Determining effective measures to alleviate the impact of climate change on crops under various regional environments is one of the most urgent issues facing agriculture. In this study, geographic regions of South Korea for future-adjusted barley cultivation were outlined and the impact of climate change on barley production in the next 100 years was evaluated under two greenhouse gas concentration trajectory scenarios: the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. To achieve our intended study goals, a geospatial crop simulation modeling (GCSM) scheme was formulated using CERES-barley model of Decision Support System for Agricultural Technology (DSSAT) crop model package version 4.6 to simulate grid-based geospatial crop yields. Two experiments were carried out at an open field to obtain model coefficients for the nation and at temperature gradient field chambers to evaluate the performance of the CERES-barley model under elevated temperature conditions. Suitable cultivation regions for three different types of barley (naked, hooded, and malting) under changing climate were projected to expand to the northern regions under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. However, they were projected to expand more rapidly under RCP 8.5 than those under RCP 4.5. Projected yields of four barley varieties were increased with a slow phase as year progressed under RCP 4.5 scenario. However, they were rapidly increased under RCP 8.5 scenario. It appears that geospatial variation in barley yield under changing climate can be effectively outlined. Therefore, GCSM system might be useful for determining impacts of climate change on geospatial variations of crops, potentially providing means to impede food insecurity."
High frequency shoot proliferation from cotyledonary node of Lawsonia inermis L. and validation of their molecular finger printing,"An efficient and reproducible protocol for in vitro plant regeneration was developed for Lawsonia inermis L. using cotyledonary node explant derived from axenic seedlings. Highest shoot proliferation frequency (ca 96.6%) was achieved on Murashige and Skoog’s, 1962 (MS) basal medium supplemented with 8.88 μM 6-Benzyladenine (BA) + 2.68 μM Napthalene acetic acid (NAA). Up-scaling of shoots was carried out using in vitro nodes on MS medium supplemented with 4.44 μM BA. So overall, an average of 238 shoots was produced at 75 days. Of the four different forms of cotyledonary node explants evaluated, highest shoot multiplication was observed in cotyledonary node explant with two whole cotyledons. In vitro regenerated shoots were best rooted (ca 34.3 roots / shoot) on ½ MS medium devoid of any growth regulator. The plantlets were successfully acclimated in sand:soil:: 1:1and established in the garden soil. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis revealed a homogeneous amplification profile for all micropropagated plants validating the genetic fidelity of the in vitro-regenerated plants and supporting the regeneration protocol for economic commercial exploitation."
Identification and validation of cold responsive microRNAs of Hevea brasiliensis using high throughput sequencing,"Cold stress is one of the major abiotic factors that influence the productivity and geographical distribution of many agriculturally important crops like Hevea brasiliensis. Cultivation of H. brasiliensis in India is being extended to northeastern regions, where low temperature during winter adversely affects its survival, growth, and productivity. Developing cold-tolerant genotypes is a primary requisite to maximize the productivity under such challenging environmental conditions. However, lack of methods for early evaluation of cold tolerance in the newly developed clones and the extensive time required for assessing their tolerance in the field are major constraints for clonal selection. The present study was initiated with an objective to identify and characterize cold stress responsive miRNAs from H. brasiliensis that show stronger association with cold tolerance. Next generation sequencing using Illumina HiSeq method revealed the expression of 21 and 29 conserved miRNA (from clone RRIM 600) families in cold-stressed and control samples, respectively. Forty-two novel miRNAs were identified from this study. Upon differential expression analysis, eight conserved miRNAs were found commonly expressed in both the samples. When expression analyses were performed subsequently with six selected miRNAs in two Hevea clones (viz. RRII 105 and RRIM 600), miR169 showed a strong association with cold tolerance. miRNAs such as miR482 and miR159 also exhibited association with cold tolerance. This study suggests the possibility of employing these miRNAs as markers for cold tolerance after validation in more number of genotypes with varying levels of cold tolerance."
Prediction of malignancy of submandibular gland tumors with apparent diffusion coefficient,This study was performed to predict malignancy of submandibular gland tumors using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).
Paradoxical impact of decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at baseline on the long-term prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome,"Although statin therapy is beneficial in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a substantial proportion of patients with ACS still do not receive the guideline-recommended lipid management in contemporary practice. We hypothesize that the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the time of admission might affect patient management and the subsequent outcome. Nine-hundred and forty-two consecutive patients with ACS who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention were analyzed retrospectively. The study patients were first divided into two groups based on the LDL-C level on admission: group A (n = 267), with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; and group B (n = 675), with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. Each group was then further divided into those who were prescribed statins or not at the time of discharge from the hospital. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. In addition, we analyzed the serial changes of LDL-C within 1 year. Patients in group A were significantly older and more likely to have multiple comorbidities compared with group B. The proportion of patients who were prescribed statin at discharge was significantly smaller in group A compared with group B (57.7 vs. 77.3%, p < 0.001). During the median 4-year follow-up, there were 122 incidents of all-cause death. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that LDL-C < 100 mg/dL on admission [hazard ratio (HR), 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–2.39; p < 0.05] and prescription of statins at discharge (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.76; p < 0.001) were associated significantly with all-cause death. Under these conditions, increasing LDL-C levels were documented during follow-up in those patients in group A when no statins were prescribed at discharge (79 ± 15–96 ± 29 mg/dL, p < 0.001), whereas these remained unchanged when statins were prescribed at discharge (79 ± 15–77 ± 22 mg/dL, p = 0.30). These results demonstrate that decreased LDL-C on admission in ACS led to less prescription for statins, which could result in increased death, probably due to underestimation of the baseline LDL-C."
The potential of endoglucanases to rapidly and specifically enhance the rheological properties of micro/nanofibrillated cellulose,"The rheological properties of fluids such as paints, coatings, and cosmetics play an important role in determining the effectiveness and desirability of these materials. Typically, these fluids must be relatively viscous and must exhibit shear-thinning characteristics. Previous work has shown that a variety of fibrous cellulosic materials, particularly nanocellulosic products, can impart shear-thinning characteristics to fluids to which they are added. In the work reported here, highly refined micro/nanofibrillated cellulose (MNFC) was assessed for its potential to impart desirable rheological properties to aqueous systems. When endoglucanases were assessed for their ability to influence the rheological properties of MNFC suspensions it was apparent that significant changes in the viscosity and shear-thinning properties of MNFC could be achieved using very low enzyme loadings (< 0.5 mg/g cellulose) within a relatively short timeframe (< 30 min). It is likely that the observed reductions in viscosity arise not just from reductions in the aspect ratio of the cellulosic fibrils, but also through disentanglement of interfibril interactions resulting from enzymatic smoothing of the fibre surfaces."
Cross-Layer Based Error Control Technique for WSN with Modified Relay Node Selection and Corruption Aware Method,"In Wireless Sensor Network, packet failure or error is to be controlled possibly. Based on that, we presented Cross-layer Based Error Control Technique for WSN in our previous work. In this paper, we present Modified relay node selection and corruption aware method for further improve the performance of the network. Modified relay nodes are selected using Markov chain decision process. Three relay selection methods are discussed in this paper. Those methods are “permanent”, “reactive”, and “adaptive”, which have various mandates for relay update. After the relay node selection, data packets are transmitted to the destination by selecting these relay nodes. At the receiver, the received data packet is verified whether it is corrupted or not using Received Signal Strength Indicator. If the received packet is corrupted, then the corrupted packet is encoded before re transmission using Low Density Parity Check Codes. Simulation results show that performance of this work is superior to our previous work in terms of delivery ratio and packet drop."
Secured and Imperceptible Data Transmission Through Digital Audio Signal with Reduced Internal Noise,"The work proposed in this paper aims at two major concerns of wireless transmission, which are security and imperceptibility of the transmitting data. This method uses a digital audio signal as carrier for the actual message data to be transmitted in a concealed form and has two complementary parts, insertion of payload in a source audio signal at the sender end and retrieval of payload at the receiver end. To enhance security of the system, three fold measure has been taken to safeguard the hidden data from any potential hacking attempt. These are, (1) insertion of payload in transformed domain based on DFT instead of time domain, (2) use of pseudo-random bit positions for insertion and (3) using a common secret key by both sending and receiving parties. Imperceptibility of the transmitting data is also emphasized by reducing the internal noise impact within the carrier audio signal at the time of insertion. Furthermore, the integrity and authenticity of the retrieved message is verified at the receiving end. The proposed method has been thoroughly examined by various performance metrics in different scenarios, which prove its effectiveness."

Determinants of Anxiety and Depression Among University Students of Lahore,"Benefits from an improved understanding of mental health of young adults, particularly students, affecting their academic performance are likely to be numerous. Thus, we aimed at evaluating anxiety and depression among annual and semester university students of Lahore, Pakistan. A cross-sectional study of 7 months duration was designed by enrolling a total of 404 students from two private and two public sector universities of Lahore. We found significant differences in frequency distribution with regard to age (p = 0.003), marital status (p = 0.01), living status (p = 0.004), and reasons affecting of mental health (p = 0.004) between annual and semester system students. Students enrolled in annual system exhibited higher odds of anxiety, mild (OR 2.7, p = 0.019), and extremely severe (OR 2.6, p = 0.002), compared to semester students. In overall assessment of university students, after univariate analysis, multivariate analysis demonstrated significant association of depression with male students (OR 2.3, p = 0.001), age ≤ 22 years (OR 2.8, p = 0.0005) and living status (OR 5.96, p = 0.0005). Similarly, as for anxiety, only male students demonstrated higher odds of anxiety (OR 2.8, p = 0.0005). As expected, compared to a single reason, multiple reasons affecting student’s mental health demonstrated significant association with all three determinants of mental health, i.e., stress (OR 0.36, p = 0.0005), anxiety (OR 0.31, p = 0.0005), and depression (OR 0.5, p = 0.0005). Taken together, these data suggested higher prevalence of anxiety among annual system students, mainly because of studies, while in overall assessment male students and students at an early stage of their life at the university were susceptible to anxiety and depression, probably due to multiple reasons affecting their mental health."
Prediction of Bearing Capacity of Stone Columns Placed in Soft Clay Using ANN Model,"It is known that the construction over soft clay is always a great challenge to the geotechnical engineers. The soft clay poses high compressibility and low bearing capacity. It is a common practice to construct piles in the soft clay to transfer the superimposed load to the hard strata below. Construction of stone columns is also a technique of ground improvement normally applied to the soft clay for increase in bearing capacity and reduction in compressibility. Many theories are developed to determine the bearing of a soft soil reinforced with stone columns. However, most of the theories are site specific and do not show a very good match with the field observations. Artificial neural network (ANN) is an analytical tool which can be used to predict some specific behavior of soil like bearing capacity, settlement, etc. based on some input properties like density, shear strength parameters, void ratio, etc. In the present study, 90 data were collected from the previously published literatures to build an ANN model. Five parameters, namely, un-drained cohesion of soft clay (cu), friction angle of stone column material (ϕ), ratio of spacing to diameter of the stone columns (s/d), length of the stone column (l) and number of the stone columns (n) were taken as input data and the bearing capacity as an output. The predicted bearing capacity was compared with the laboratory experimental data and Plaxis 2D data. The predicted values were also compared with the values obtained from the established theories. ANN predicated values showed a very good match even better than any of the established theories. Sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of the ϕ value is maximum on determination of the bearing capacity."
"Charmonia production from b-hadron decays at LHC with \(k_T\)-factorization: \(J/\psi \), \(\psi (2S)\) and \(J/\psi + Z\)","We consider the production of \(J/\psi \) and \(\psi (2S)\) mesons originating from the decays of b-flavored hadrons at the LHC using the \(k_T\)-factorization approach. Our analysis covers both inclusive charmonia production and production of \(J/\psi \) mesons in association with Z bosons. We apply the transverse momentum dependent (or unintegrated) gluon density in a proton derived from Catani–Ciafaloni–Fiorani–Marchesini (CCFM) evolution equation and adopt fragmentation functions based on the non-relativistic QCD factorization to describe the inclusive b-hadron decays into the different charmonium states. Our predictions agree well with latest experimental data taken by the CMS, ATLAS and LHCb Collaborations at \(\sqrt{s} = 7\), 8 and 13 TeV. The contributions from double parton scattering to the associated non-prompt \(J/\psi + Z\) production are estimated and found to be small."
CP violation in leptonic rare \(B^0_s\) decays as a probe of new physics,"The decay \(B^0_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\) is a key probe for the search of physics beyond the Standard Model. While the current measurements of the corresponding branching ratio agree with the Standard Model within the uncertainties, significant New-Physics effects may still be hiding in \(B^0_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\). In order to reveal them, the observable \(\mathcal {A}^{\mu \mu }_{\Delta \Gamma _s}\), which is provided by the decay width difference \(\Delta \Gamma _s\) of the \(B^0_s\)-meson system, plays a central role. We point out that a measurement of a CP-violating observable \(\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{\mu \mu }\), which is induced through interference between \(B^0_s\)–\({\bar{B}}^0_s\) mixing and \(B_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\) decay processes, is essential to obtain the full picture, in particular to establish new scalar contributions and CP-violating phases. We illustrate these findings with future scenarios for the upgrade(s) of the LHC, exploiting also relations which emerge within an effective field theory description of the Standard Model, complemented with New Physics entering significantly beyond the electroweak scale."
Alpha decay studies on Po isotopes using different versions of nuclear potentials,"The alpha decays from 186-224Po isotopes have been studied using 25 different versions of nuclear potentials so as to select a suitable nuclear potential for alpha decay studies. The computed standard deviation of the calculated half-lives in comparison with the experimental data suggested that proximity 2003-I is the apt form of nuclear potential for alpha decay studies as it possesses the least standard deviation, \( \sigma =0.620\) . Among the different proximity potentials, proximity 1966 ( \( \sigma =0.630\) and proximity 1977 ( \( \sigma =0.636\) , are also found to work well in alpha decay studies with low deviation. Among other versions of nuclear potentials (other than proximity potentials), Bass 1980 is suggested to be a significant form of nuclear potential because of its good predictive power. However, while the other forms of potentials are able to reproduce the experimental data to some extent, these potentials cannot be considered as apposite potentials for alpha decay studies in their present form. Since the experimental correlation of the models is noticed to be satisfying, the alpha decay half-lives of certain Po isotopes that are not detected experimentally yet have been predicted."
On the sum of digits of special sequences in finite fields,"In \(\mathbb {F}_q\), Dartyge and Sárközy introduced the notion of digits and studied some properties of the sum of digits function. We will provide sharp estimates for the number of elements of special sequences of \(\mathbb {F}_q\) whose sum of digits is prescribed. Such special sequences of particular interest include the set of n-th powers for each \(n\ge 1\) and the set of elements of order d in \(\mathbb {F}_q^*\) for each divisor d of \(q-1\). We provide an optimal estimate for the number of squares whose sum of digits is prescribed. Our methods combine A. Weil bounds with character sums, Gaussian sums and exponential sums."
"Analysis of ibuprofen and its main metabolites in roots, shoots, and seeds of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry: uptake, metabolism, and translocation","A liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–QqTOF-MS/MS) method was developed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of ibuprofen (IBU), 1- and 2-hydroxyibuprofen (1-OH IBU and 2-OH IBU), and carboxyibuprofen (CBX IBU) while preserving the ability of the instrument to get precursor and product ion mass spectra of non-target compounds. The trigger was the precursor ions reaching 100 cps intensity. Sample preparation was carried out by ultrasound solid-liquid extraction with methanol as extraction solvent at pH < 2 followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up using STRATA-X cartridges and methanol as an eluent. Linearity was obtained in the range 50–10,000 ng mL−1 for IBU, each OH IBU and CBX IBU (r ≥ 0.99). The proposed method was satisfactorily validated showing absolute recoveries of > 70% for all target analytes at low and high concentration levels. The lowest limit of quantification was < 50 ng g−1 in plant. This method was applied to investigate IBP behavior in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) treated at high IBU concentrations and its presence in vegetables irrigated with treated water. Up to 46 metabolites, mostly hydroxylated metabolites and conjugates with hexosides and amino acids, were identified. The most abundant metabolites were also identified in an eggplant sample."
Transverse Isotropy of Phyllite Under Brazilian Tests: Laboratory Testing and Numerical Simulations,"Phyllite is a low-grade, metamorphic rock with well-developed foliation. We characterized the fracture pattern and failure strength of phyllite specimens under Brazilian tests. The specimens were obtained from the Zhegu mountain tunnel in China and had different foliation-loading angles, namely 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90°. The processes for the initiation and propagation of macro-cracks were recorded using high-speed photography. The evolution of micro-cracks was analyzed based on the results of acoustic emission (AE) tests. The failure process of the specimens during the Brazilian tests was simulated with a new numerical approach based on the particle discrete element method. The influence of foliation strength and the microstructure of the rock matrix were also studied numerically. The experimental results showed that the failure strength of the specimens was related to their fracture patterns and the areas of their fracture surfaces. The initial cracking point of the specimens appeared at the upper or lower loading position, and the cracks propagated to the boundaries of the specimens along or across foliation. The temporal distributions of the AE counts and AE energy of the specimens were affected predominantly by the fracture pattern, and we divided these distributions into two modes: the peak mode and the uniformly distributed mode. The numerical results indicated that the fracture surface was roughly parallel to the loading direction and that the surface was located in the central part of the disk specimens for rocks with loose structure (low coordination number or large crack density) or with strong foliation, i.e., foliation with high shear strength. The failure pattern and trends of variation in failure strength as a function of foliation-loading angles varied with the ratio of cohesion to the tensile strength of foliation, the crack density, and the coordination number."
Unconditionally secure multi-party quantum commitment scheme,"A new unconditionally secure multi-party quantum commitment is proposed in this paper by encoding the committed message to the phase of a quantum state. Multi-party means that there are more than one recipient in our scheme. We show that our quantum commitment scheme is unconditional hiding and binding, and hiding is perfect. Our technique is based on the interference of phase-encoded coherent states of light. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning theorem of quantum theory and the properties of quantum information."
Quality of life at 6 years after occupational injury,"Occupational injuries have considerable impact on workers’ lives. However, data regarding workers’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at several years after the injury are lacking. This study assessed workers’ HRQOL at 6 years after occupational injury and determined related factors in each HRQOL domain."
Local optimality of cubic lattices for interaction energies,"We study the local optimality of simple cubic, body-centred-cubic and face-centred-cubic lattices among Bravais lattices of fixed density for some finite energy per point. Following the work of Ennola (Math Proc Camb 60:855–875, 1964), we prove that these lattices are critical points of all the energies, we write the second derivatives in a simple way and we investigate the local optimality of these lattices for the theta function and the Lennard–Jones-type energies. In particular, we prove the local minimality of the FCC lattice (resp. BCC lattice) for large enough (resp. small enough) values of its scaling parameter and we also prove the fact that the simple cubic lattice is a saddle point of the energy. Furthermore, we prove the local minimality of the FCC and the BCC lattices at high density (with an optimal explicit bound) and its local maximality at low density in the Lennard–Jones-type potential case. We then show the local minimality of FCC and BCC lattices among all the Bravais lattices (without a density constraint). The largest possible open interval of density’s values where the simple cubic lattice is a local minimizer is also computed."

Corneal delivery of besifloxacin using rapidly dissolving polymeric microneedles,"Penetration of antibiotics into and through the cornea is a major limiting factor in the treatment of ocular infections. Several strategies are in vogue to overcome this limitation such as use of fortified drops, gels, and subconjunctival injections. Here, we present the fabrication of rapidly dissolving polymeric microneedle array to effectively deliver besifloxacin through the cornea. Microneedles were prepared using polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone by the micromolding technique. The model fluoroquinolone antibiotic, besifloxacin, was loaded in 36 microneedles arranged in a 6 × 6 array format within a 1 cm2 area. The average height and base width of microneedles was 961 ± 27 and 366 ± 16 μm, respectively. Each microneedle array contained 103.4 ± 8.5 μg of besifloxacin. Cryosectioning and confocal microscopy of excised human cornea revealed that microneedles penetrated to a depth of up to 200 μm. Microneedles were found to completely dissolve in the cornea within 5 min. Application of microneedles for 5 min significantly (p < 0.05) improved the besifloxacin deposition and permeation through the cornea compared with free besifloxacin solution. Similarly, besifloxacin-loaded microneedles showed greater antibacterial activity in Staphylococcus aureus-infected cornea in comparison to free besifloxacin solution. Taken together, rapidly dissolving microneedles can be developed to effectively deliver besifloxacin to treat bacterial infections in the cornea and eye."
"Ring-core method in determining the amount of non-uniform residual stress in laminated composites: experimental, finite element and theoretical evaluation","Residual stresses in composite constructions are created because of non-uniform contraction of layers during cooling from curing to ambient temperature. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of incremental ring-core method to estimate non-uniform residual stresses in various laminates of polymer matrix composites. To carry out this test, glass/epoxy specimens were selected in two different types of symmetric cross-ply laminate \(\left( \left[ 0^{\circ }_{4}/90^{\circ }_{4}\right] _{S}\right) \) and symmetric quasi-isotropic laminate \(\left( \left[ 0^{\circ }_{2}/\pm 45^{\circ }/90^{\circ }_{2}\right] _{S}\right) \). The samples were created using hand layup and vacuum bagging. By experimental tests, released strains measured during milling process and coefficient factors for every annular groove machining operations were obtained by finite element modeling. As well, residual stresses were calculated by classical lamination plate theory. For symmetric cross-ply, the maximum difference between experimental and theoretical results was about 16%, which was observed in the first and eighth layers. Symmetric quasi-isotropic specimen showed also good agreement between the results and the maximum measurement error of 8% was observed. For the mentioned two cases, summation of components of the residual stress in all directions is near to zero. The results of this study show that in the ring-core method, because of the nature and higher volume of material removal than other methods, values of residual stress released are higher and the results have a good consistency compared with the theoretical values."
Strain effect on the electronic properties of III-nitride nanosheets: Ab-initio study,"In this study the structural and electronic properties of III-nitride monolayers XN (X=B, Al, Ga and In) under different percentages of homogeneous and shear strain are investigated using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave within the density functional theory. Geometry optimizations indicate that GaN and InN monolayers get buckled under compressive strain. Our calculations show that the free-strains of these four monolayers have an indirect band gap. By applying compressive biaxial strain, a transition from indirect to direct band gap occurs for GaN and InN, while the character of band gap for BN and AlN is not changed. Under tensile strain, only BN monolayer behaves as direct band gap semiconductor. In addition, when the shear strain is applied, only InN undergoes an indirect to direct band gap transition. Furthermore, the variations of band gap versus strain for III-nitride monolayers have been calculated. When a homogeneous uniform strain, in the range of [−10%, +10%], is applied to the monolayers, the band gap can be tuned for from 3.92 eV to 4.58 eV for BN, from 1.67 eV to 3.46 eV for AlN, from 0.24 eV to 2.79 eV for GaN and from 0.60 eV to 0.90 eV for InN."
Chinese herbal medicine TangBi Formula treatment of patients with type 2 diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and it has become a major public health problem worldwide because of its high and increasing prevalence, morbidity, and disability rate. The current medications for DSPN are not entirely satisfactory. Preliminary studies indicated that the Chinese herbal TangBi Formula may alleviate signs and symptoms and improve the velocity of nerve conduction in patients with DSPN. This study was designed to determine if Chinese herbal medicine used in combination with conventional treatment is more effective than conventional treatment alone."

Bacterial diversity of wild-caught Lutzomyia longipalpis (a vector of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil) under distinct physiological conditions by metagenomics analysis,"The leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by protozoans of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. In the New World, Lutzomyia longipalpis is the most important vector of visceral leishmaniasis and is a proven vector for Leishmania infantum chagasi in Brazil. During development within the vector, Leishmania can interact with a variety of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. The presence of bacteria in the midgut of sand flies can influence the development and survival of the parasite."
Substituted group-directed assembly of six coordination compounds based on pyrazole bifunctional ligands,"Six new complexes [Mn8(μ4-O)4(phpz)8(MeOH)4]·(MeOH)(H2O) (1) [Co2(HphpzH)(Hphpz)2(phpz)2]·4(MeOH) (2), Ni(Hphpz)2 (3), [Ni(Hphpz)2]·H2O (4), [Zn4(pzpy)4Cl4] (5) and [Cu2(pzpy)2(HCO2)2(H2O)2] (6) have been synthesized by hydrothermal reactions of MCl2·4H2O (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn or Cu) with 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-pyrazole (HphpzH) or 2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (Hpzpy). The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 is an octanuclear Mn(III) cluster, complexes 2 and 6 are binuclear Co(III) and Cu(II), respectively, complexes 3 and 4 are isomorphous mononuclear species, while complex 5 is a tetranuclear Zn(II) cluster. The magnetic behavior of complex 1 was investigated. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centers in the clusters. The luminescence properties of the complexes were investigated at room temperature in the solid state."

Preliminary investigations into nano-finishing of freeform surface (femoral) using inverse replica fixture,"It is difficult to achieve nano-level surface finish on freeform surfaces. Femoral (knee joint) is one of such components which has freeform surface. Finishing operations are very costly and time consuming. Surface finish of femoral plays a major role in its functionality, efficiency, and life expectancy. To have uniform (or minimum variation) surface roughness value along its curvature, an inverse replica of the femoral component as a fixture has been designed and fabricated so that the magnetorheological (MR) fluid velocity is approximately constant in different areas of the femoral. In this work, an attempt has been made for achieving comparatively more uniform finish on different surfaces and reducing the time required for finishing femoral. For this, a special tooling is used in rotational-magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (R-MRAFF) process. Different extrusion pressures have been used to examine the effect on percentage change in Ra, finishing rate, and final surface finish of the femoral in both directions, X and Y. Minimum surface roughness of 78 and 89 nm has been achieved on femoral from the initial surface roughness of 172 and 178 nm in X- and Y-directions, respectively."
Solid-state synthesis of ZnO nanorods coupled with reduced graphene oxide for photocatalytic application,"ZnO is an excellent semiconductor material for photocatalytic application. To overcome the photocorrosion of ZnO and improve its stability, nanorods (NRs) structured ZnO is prepared by an environment-friendly solid state synthesis method, and the composite of ZnO with different mass ratio of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are obtained via a hydrothermal reaction. According to the photocatalytic results, 5% RGO composited with ZnO NRs degrades the methylene orange solution completely (98%) in 50 min under UV light irradiation, whereas bare ZnO NRs just degrade 40.9%. The transient photocurrent responses and electronical impedance spectroscopy tests are carried out to illustrate the mechanism of RGO in the nanocomposite for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. This composite of ZnO/RGO has demonstrated a great potential for high efficient and stable photocatalytic application."
Light intensity dependent characteristics of micro-textured Si/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction solar cell,"Heterojunction solar cells made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and Si have attracted a lot of attention towards low-cost and efficient devices. Here, heterojunction solar cell using pristine PEDOT:PSS on micro-textured n-Si has been fabricated. Effect of light intensity on photovoltaic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS/Si cells has been investigated via current (J) versus voltage (V) characteristics and quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. It is found that photocurrent (Jsc) of such cells deteriorates drastically at higher light intensities resulting in quite low Jsc (~ 15.0 mA/cm2) in J–V response under intense white light than that obtained from EQE measurements (> 30.0 mA/cm2) under low intensity monochromatic light. The observed effect of light intensity on the cell performances is reversible. Structural stability of PEDOT:PSS layer is also investigated by Raman spectroscopy. No post high intensity light exposure structural transformation in the PEDOT:PSS layer is observed. The observed light sensitive photoresponse of such cells has been attributed to possible light induced instantaneous structural changes in the PEDOT:PSS layer leading to reduced charge carrier dynamics and hence the formation of space charge region at PEDOT:PSS/Si interface at higher intensities. Further, the EQE with varying intensity is done which can help to optimize the illumination condition for such cell. The present study opens up new area of intensive research required in order to optimize polymer layer properties and improving the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cell leading to efficient, stable and low cost heterojunction solar cell technology."

"Formation of a spatter-rich pyroclastic density current deposit in a Neogene sequence of trachytic-mafic igneous rocks at Mason Spur, Erebus volcanic province, Antarctica","Erosion has revealed a remarkable section through the heart of a volcanic island, Mason Spur, in the southwestern Ross Sea, Antarctica, including an unusually well-exposed section of caldera fill. The near-continuous exposure, 10 km laterally and > 1 km vertically, cuts through Cenozoic alkalic volcanic rocks of the Erebus volcanic province (McMurdo Volcanic Group) and permits the study of an ancient volcanic succession that is rarely available due to subsequent burial or erosion. The caldera filling sequence includes an unusual trachytic spatter-rich lapilli tuff (ignimbrite) facies that is particularly striking because of the presence of abundant black fluidal, dense juvenile spatter clasts of trachytic obsidian up to 2 m long supported in a pale cream-coloured pumiceous lapilli tuff matrix. Field mapping indicates that the deposit is an ignimbrite and, together with petrological considerations, it is suggested that mixing of dense spatter and pumiceous lapilli tuff in the investigated deposit occurred during emplacement, not necessarily in the same vent, with the mixed fragmental material emplaced as a pyroclastic density current. Liquid water was not initially present but a steam phase was probably generated during transport and may represent water ingested during passage of the current as it passed over either wet ground, stream, shallow lake or (possibly) snow. Well-exposed caldera interiors are uncommon and that at Mason Spur is helping understand eruption dynamics associated with a complex large island volcano. The results of our study should help to elucidate interpretations of other, less well exposed, pyroclastic density current deposits elsewhere in Antarctica and globally."

Characterizations of Spacelike Submanifolds with Constant Scalar Curvature in the de Sitter Space,"In this paper, we deal with complete spacelike submanifolds \(M^n\) immersed in the de Sitter space \(\mathbb S_p^{n+p}\) of index p with parallel normalized mean curvature vector and constant scalar curvature R. Imposing a suitable restriction on the values of R, we apply a maximum principle for the so-called Cheng–Yau operator L, which enables us to show that either such a submanifold must be totally umbilical or it holds a sharp estimate for the norm of its total umbilicity tensor, with equality if and only the submanifold is isometric to a hyperbolic cylinder of the ambient space. In particular, when \(n=2\) this provides a nice characterization of the totally umbilical spacelike surfaces of \(\mathbb {S}^{2+p}_p\) with codimension \(p\ge 2\). Furthermore, we also study the case in which these spacelike submanifold are L-parabolic."
Procuring price and quality using scoring auctions: where do we stand?,"This study assesses the rapidly growing literature on scoring rule auctions (SRA), in which all participants submit a multidimensional bid comprising prices and levels of one or more qualities. These elements are weighted using a linear combination, that is, the scoring function. The result of this function is a score and the bid that obtains the highest score is awarded the contract. We provide a comprehensive overview of key theoretical and empirical results. In addition, we discuss structural estimation techniques applied to SRA and we conclude with three main limitations of this awarding mechanism."

EMT is therefore becoming a potential target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Here, we showed that phoyunnanin E, a compound isolated from Dendrobium venustum, possesses anti-migration activity and addressed its mechanism of action."
Modeling and analysis for stock return movements along with exchange rates and interest rates in Markov regime-switching models,"Since the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis, the regime shift behavior has been notable in the stock markets. We examine the effects of interest rates and foreign exchange rates on stock returns and the cross-correlations of Korean stock returns associated with three other countries: Japan, USA, and China, using the Hamilton 2-regime Markov Switching model, for the period January 1993–December 2016. In both regimes, the volatility in the Korean stock market is greater than Japan and USA, but less than China. In regime 1 with low-volatility, the stock returns of both Korea and Japan are significantly affected first by their exchange rates and then by their interest rates. In regime 2 with high-volatility, the Korean stock market is explained by neither of the two exogenous variables while the Japanese stock returns respond positively to the exchange rates but negatively to the interest rates. The transition probability from regime 1 to regime 2 is greater than the reverse probability in the Korean stock market, which is opposite in Japan. Considering all four countries simultaneously, the Korean stock market is highly influenced by both the US and Japanese stock market in regime 1 with low-volatility, but only influenced by the Japanese stock market in regime 2 with high-volatility."
Paradoxical impact of decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at baseline on the long-term prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome,"Although statin therapy is beneficial in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a substantial proportion of patients with ACS still do not receive the guideline-recommended lipid management in contemporary practice. We hypothesize that the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the time of admission might affect patient management and the subsequent outcome. Nine-hundred and forty-two consecutive patients with ACS who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention were analyzed retrospectively. The study patients were first divided into two groups based on the LDL-C level on admission: group A (n = 267), with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; and group B (n = 675), with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. Each group was then further divided into those who were prescribed statins or not at the time of discharge from the hospital. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. In addition, we analyzed the serial changes of LDL-C within 1 year. Patients in group A were significantly older and more likely to have multiple comorbidities compared with group B. The proportion of patients who were prescribed statin at discharge was significantly smaller in group A compared with group B (57.7 vs. 77.3%, p < 0.001). During the median 4-year follow-up, there were 122 incidents of all-cause death. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that LDL-C < 100 mg/dL on admission [hazard ratio (HR), 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–2.39; p < 0.05] and prescription of statins at discharge (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.76; p < 0.001) were associated significantly with all-cause death. Under these conditions, increasing LDL-C levels were documented during follow-up in those patients in group A when no statins were prescribed at discharge (79 ± 15–96 ± 29 mg/dL, p < 0.001), whereas these remained unchanged when statins were prescribed at discharge (79 ± 15–77 ± 22 mg/dL, p = 0.30). These results demonstrate that decreased LDL-C on admission in ACS led to less prescription for statins, which could result in increased death, probably due to underestimation of the baseline LDL-C."

De novo metastasis in breast cancer: occurrence and overall survival stratified by molecular subtype,"Breast cancer molecular subtypes, categorized jointly by hormone receptors (HR) and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2), are utilized to guide systemic therapy. We hypothesized distinct patterns of de novo metastasis and overall survival by molecular subtype using a retrospective cohort of 399,772 women in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with first primary invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2014, of whom 13,924 were diagnosed with de novo metastasis from 2010 to 2013 and had follow up data. The relationship of molecular subtype with patient and tumor characteristics, including site of de novo metastasis, were examined using Chi-squared tests. Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine overall survival by molecular subtype. Bone was the most frequent de novo metastatic site for all molecular subtypes. Compared to HR+/HER2−, patients with HR−/HER2+ experienced 4.5, 3.0, and 6.0 times the de novo brain, lung, and liver metastasis respectively. In survival analyses of women diagnosed with de novo metastasis, the mortality risk relative to HR+/HER2− was twice as high for triple-negative (hazard ratio = 2.02, 95% CI 1.89–2.16) and modestly lower for HR+/HER2+ (hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78–0.88). The median survival difference between metastatic patients with and without chemotherapy was 28.6 months in HR+/HER2+ and 28.2 months in HR−/HER2+, but only 10.9 months in triple-negative and 5.2 months in HR+/HER2−. In conclusion, despite unfavorable patterns of de novo metastasis, HER2+ breast cancers had relatively better survival in recent years, probably due to treatment differences. Utilizing molecular subtype and site of de novo metastasis may predict prognosis and guide treatment."
Functional and DNA–protein binding studies of WRKY transcription factors and their expression analysis in response to biotic and abiotic stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"WRKY, a plant-specific transcription factor family, plays vital roles in pathogen defense, abiotic stress, and phytohormone signalling. Little is known about the roles and function of WRKY transcription factors in response to rust diseases in wheat. In the present study, three TaWRKY genes encoding complete protein sequences were cloned. They belonged to class II and III WRKY based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of zinc finger structures. Twenty-two DNA–protein binding docking complexes predicted stable interactions of WRKY domain with W-box. Quantitative real-time-PCR using wheat near-isogenic lines with or without Lr28 gene revealed differential up- or down-regulation in response to biotic and abiotic stress treatments which could be responsible for their functional divergence in wheat. TaWRKY62 was found to be induced upon treatment with JA, MJ, and SA and reduced after ABA treatments. Maximum induction of six out of seven genes occurred at 48 h post inoculation due to pathogen inoculation. Hence, TaWRKY (49, 50, 52, 55, 57, and 62) can be considered as potential candidate genes for further functional validation as well as for crop improvement programs for stress resistance. The results of the present study will enhance knowledge towards understanding the molecular basis of mode of action of WRKY transcription factor genes in wheat and their role during leaf rust pathogenesis in particular."
The SEEA-Based Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling Framework: An Illustration with Guatemala’s Forest and Fuelwood Sector,"This paper develops and operationalizes the integrated economic-environmental modelling (IEEM) platform which integrates environmental data organized under the first international system of environmental economic accounting with a powerful dynamic economy-wide modelling approach. IEEM enables the ex-ante economic analysis of policies on the economy and the environment in a quantitative, comprehensive and consistent framework. IEEM elucidates the two-way interrelationships between the economy and environment, considering how economic activities depend on the environment as a source of inputs and as a sink for their outputs. In addition to standard economic impact indicators such as gross domestic product, income and employment, IEEM generates indicators that describe policy impacts on the use of environmental resources, wealth and environmental quality which together determine prospects for future economic growth and well-being. To illustrate the analytical capabilities of IEEM, the model is calibrated with Guatemala’s SEEA and applied to analysis of its forest and fuelwood sector where negative health and environmental impacts arise from inefficient fuelwood use."
"RASSF1A promoter methylation was associated with the development, progression and metastasis of cervical carcinoma: a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis","RASSF1A promoter methylation has been reported in cervical cancer. However, clinical effect of RASSF1A promoter methylation in cervical cancer remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between RASSF1A promoter methylation and cervical cancer and the association of RASSF1A promoter methylation with clinicopathological features."
Membrane sweeping added to formal induction method to increase the spontaneous vaginal delivery: a meta-analysis,"Membrane sweeping (MS) could increase the likelihood of spontaneous labor within 48 h. However, the rationale for performing routinely an intervention with the potential to induce labor in women with an uneventful pregnancy at 38 weeks of gestation is, at least, questionable. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies to assess evaluated the effect of MS added to formal induction method on the spontaneous vaginal delivery, compared with formal induction alone."
Predicting Cu and Zn sorption capacity of biochar from feedstock C/N ratio and pyrolysis temperature,"Biochars have been proposed for remediation of metal-contaminated water due to their low cost, high surface area and high sorption capacity for metals. However, there is a lack of understanding over how feedstock material and pyrolysis conditions contribute to the metal sorption capacity of biochar. We produced biochars from 10 different organic materials by pyrolysing at 450 °C and a further 10 biochars from cedar wood by pyrolysing at 50 °C intervals (250–700 °C). Batch sorption experiments were conducted to derive the maximum Cu and Zn sorption capacity of each biochar. The results revealed an exponential relationship between Cu and Zn sorption capacity and the feedstock C/N ratio and a sigmoidal relationship between the pyrolysis temperature and the maximum Cu and Zn sorption capacity. FTIR analysis revealed that as temperature increased, the abundance of functional groups reduced. We conclude that the high sorption capacity of high temperature biochars is due to an electrostatic attraction between positively charged Cu and Zn ions and delocalised pi-electrons on the greater surface area of these biochars. These findings demonstrate a method for predicting the maximum sorption capacity of a biochar based on the feedstock C/N ratio and the pyrolysis temperature."
Does Parent Training Format Affect Treatment Engagement? A Randomized Study of Families at Social Risk,"We examined whether parent engagement in parent training (PT) differed based on PT format (parent group-based with video versus mastery-based individual coaching with child) in an economically disadvantaged sample of families seeking behavioral treatment for their preschool children in an urban mental health clinic. Parents (N = 159; 76.1% mothers, 69.8% African American, 73% low-income) were randomized to one of two interventions, Chicago Parent Program (parent group + video; CPP) or Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (individualized mastery-based coaching; PCIT). Parent engagement indicators compared were PT attendance and completion rates, participation quality, and parent satisfaction. Risk factors predictive of PT attrition (parent depression, psychosocial adversity, child behavior problem severity, length of wait time to start PT) were also compared to determine whether they were more likely to affect engagement in one PT format versus the other. No significant differences were found in PT attendance or completion rates by format. Clinicians rated parents’ engagement higher in PCIT than in CPP while satisfaction with PT was rated higher by parents in CPP compared to PCIT. Never attending PT was associated with more psychosocial adversity and externalizing behavior problems for CPP and with higher baseline depression for PCIT. Parents with more psychosocial adversities and higher baseline depression were less likely to complete PCIT. None of the risk factors differentiated CPP completers from non-completers. Delay to treatment start was longer for PCIT than CPP. Strengths and limitations of each PT format are discussed as they relate to the needs and realities of families living in urban poverty."
A novel method to fabricate silicon nanoprobe array with ultra-sharp tip on (111) silicon wafer,"In the work, a novel fabrication method for homogeneous and sharp nanoprobe array on (111) silicon wafer is presented. The specific spatial structure of {111} planes and the unique anisotropic etching mechanism on (111) wafer were utilized to form a size controllable funnel-neck structure. A highly downscaled size-reduction technology is developed for precise size control. Followed with a self-limiting oxidation procedure, sharp and long needles can be made with precise size control requiring only a series of conventional processes (dry etching of silicon by DRIE, anisotropic wet etching by potassium hydroxide solution and thermal-oxidation-based tip sharpening). The fabricated probe, whose tip’s diameter is less than 30 nm, can potentially have broad application to cell research."
Multiple functions of CREB-binding protein during postembryonic development: identification of target genes,"Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect."
The emerging picture of the mitochondrial protein import complexes of Amoebozoa supergroup,"The existence of mitochondria-related organelles (MROs) is proposed for eukaryotic organisms. The Amoebozoa includes some organisms that are known to have mitosomes but also organisms that have aerobic mitochondria. However, the mitochondrial protein apparatus of this supergroup remains largely unsampled, except for the mitochondrial outer membrane import complexes studied recently. Therefore, in this study we investigated the mitochondrial inner membrane and intermembrane space complexes, using the available genome and transcriptome sequences."
Evaluation of vertebral artery anomaly in basilar invagination and prevention of vascular injury during surgical intervention: CTA features and analysis,"To evaluate vertebral artery anomaly at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) in patients with basilar invagination (BI) by computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and to discuss the prevention strategy of vascular injury."
"Potential demographic, clinical, and environment risk factors for canine visceral leishmaniasis using IFAT and nested PCR, southeastern Iran","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal disease with major veterinary and medical impacts. In the present study, we investigated the significance of potential demographic, clinical, and environmental risk factors for canine VL (CVL), southeastern Iran. This study was performed between 2014 and 2015 on 210 randomly selected stray dogs which were caught by live traps. A 5 ml blood sample was taken from cephalic vein for indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and nested PCR. The cut-off titer for IFAT was 1:320. For molecular test, two sets of general and specific primers were used to amplify variable mini circle region of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Data analyses were performed by x
2 and logistic regression tests at P < 0.05. Overall, 210 dogs consisting of 87 males and 123 females were examined and 14 dogs (6.7%) were considered infected with VL. Age < 2 years (OR = 14.106, CI = 1.810–109.924, P = 0.012); short hair (OR = 15.311 CI = 1.965–119.324, P = 0.009); solid waste (OR = 0.050 CI = 0.006–0.388, P = 0.004); weather with water, clouds, and creek (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.011–0.692, P = 0.021); and nearby dog present (OR = 0.065, CI 0.008–0.509, P = 0.009) were the major risk factors associated with CVL. In contrast, sex, tick infested, meadow, and clinical signs were negatively associated odds of infection. Control approaches should be directed toward specific demographic and environmental factors to reduce the risk of CVL in the area."
Comparison of efficacies of fetal bovine sera from different suppliers in cell culture experiments,"Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is widely used as a culture medium supplement. A high degree of variations is observed among FBS samples produced by different suppliers. The purpose of the present study was to compare between the quality and characteristics of FBS produced at Avicenna Research Institute (ARI-FBS) and a commercial FBS. Blood samples were taken from 50 healthy bovine fetuses at 2–9 months of age. Following clotting of the blood, samples were centrifuged. Their sera were collected under sterile conditions. After irradiation, to investigate the performance and quality assurance of the serum samples, some biological properties in cell culture applications, including capacities in supporting single cell growth, proliferation, and cell viability were examined by cell cloning, MTT assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Comparison of ARI-FBS with commercial FBS showed that both of them were expedient and reliable for use in culture studies. However, significant differences in growth rates of different cell lines were observed between them. Results of MTT assay showed that L929 cell line had a significantly better viability in ARI-FBS. Conversely, PC3 and SW480 cell lines were more viable in commercial FBS. In cloning experiments and flow cytometry, both sera showed similar efficiencies. ARI-FBS supported cell growth and maintained cell viabilities in a similar manner to the commercial FBS. ARI-FBS may thus be a proper alternative for commercial FBS as a growth-promoting component for successful culture of cell lines."
Characterizations of Spacelike Submanifolds with Constant Scalar Curvature in the de Sitter Space,"In this paper, we deal with complete spacelike submanifolds \(M^n\) immersed in the de Sitter space \(\mathbb S_p^{n+p}\) of index p with parallel normalized mean curvature vector and constant scalar curvature R. Imposing a suitable restriction on the values of R, we apply a maximum principle for the so-called Cheng–Yau operator L, which enables us to show that either such a submanifold must be totally umbilical or it holds a sharp estimate for the norm of its total umbilicity tensor, with equality if and only the submanifold is isometric to a hyperbolic cylinder of the ambient space. In particular, when \(n=2\) this provides a nice characterization of the totally umbilical spacelike surfaces of \(\mathbb {S}^{2+p}_p\) with codimension \(p\ge 2\). Furthermore, we also study the case in which these spacelike submanifold are L-parabolic."

Reservoir loading parameters at Koyna and their correspondence with reservoir triggered seismicity,"Several water reservoir loading parameters such as the rate of loading, highest water levels reached, duration of retention of high water levels and whether the previous water maxima has been exceeded or not, influence reservoir triggered seismicity (RTS) in the vicinity of Koyna and Warna reservoirs. Here we present an update in the change of these parameters and their relation with RTS in the Koyna-Warna region."
"Volcanology and lava flow morpho-types from the Koyna-Warna region, western Deccan Traps, India","Flow mapping and physical volcanology of 15 basaltic lavas exposed in three critical road pass sections (ghats) in the Koyna-Warna region of the western Deccan Traps is presented in this paper. Transitional lavas like rubbly pahoehoe are most common morpho-type exposed in these ghat sections. Sinking of rubbly breccia into flow interiors and formation of breccia-cored rosette are common in some lava flows. Few rubbly lavas exhibit slabby tendencies. The amount and nature of the associated rubble is variable and result from the mechanical fracturing and auto-brecciation of the upper vesicular crust in response to distinctive stages in the cooling, crystallization and emplacement history of individual lava flows. Occurrence of aa and pahoehoe morpho-types in the lava flow sequence is subordinate. Three prominent pahoehoe flows separated by red bole horizons are seen in the upper parts of the Kumbharli ghat. These are thick, P-type sheet pahoehoe. The pahoehoe lavas represent compound flow fields that grew by budding, endogenous lava transfer and inflation. Presence of pahoehoe lavas in the Koyna-Warna region hints at possible hitherto unrecorded southern extension of Bushe-like flow fields. This study reconfirms the existence of pahoehoe-slabby-rubbly-aa flow fields and transitions even in the upper echelons of the Deccan Trap stratigraphy. The study of morphology and internal structure of lava flows exposed at the ghat sections in the Koyna-Warna region could guide subsurface core-logging that is critical in deciphering the physical volcanology and emplacement dynamics of basaltic lava flows penetrated by drill holes sunk under the scientific deep drilling programme."
"Magnetic mineralogical variability along Deccan trap basalt borehole (KBH07), Koyna deep continental drilling program, western Maharashtra, India","A 1248 m long core (KBH 07, 17°18′07″ N; 73°47′28.2″E, 960m above msl) drilled up to basement in the Deccan traps from Koyna region was sampled at ∼10m interval for magnetic mineralogical studies.Analysis of routine rock magnetic parameters (mass specific magnetic susceptibility: χlf, frequency dependence of susceptibility: χfd, susceptibility of anhysteretic remanance: χARM, saturation isothermal remanance: SIRM, remanance coercivty: B(0)CR, SoftIRM, HardIRM, S-Ratio, SIRM/χlf, χARM/χlf) and density (σ, gm/cc) depicted significant higher order temporal variation. The χlf varies between 13 and 309 x 10-8m3/kg and is independent of density variation. The χARM, B(0)CR and S-Ratios indicate majority of SD-PSD ferrimagnets with episodes of MD ferrimagnetic concentration and few hard coercivity components. The giant plagioclase lath bearing (GPB) horizons show highest variability of ferrimagnetic concentration marked by anomalous peaks. Overall the variability of rock magnetic parameters independent of lava flow units suggest that the changeover in magnetic mineral concentration, composition and domain size occur at major episodes in magma composition (e.g., primary source, crustal contamination and fractional crystallization). The studied parameters are therefore examined to mark intervals of (i) magma compositional changes, (ii) zones of oxidative conditions and (iii) rapid/slow cooling intervals demanding detailed petrologic studies. We identified one I order trend, four II order cycles and eight III order cycles for the purpose of correlation. Notable peak in χlf at 650–700m, the changeover in rock magnetic parameters at ∼930 m and ∼280 m can facilitate marker intervals while several higher order variations can be adopted for high resolution correlation to other boreholes in the region. The complex variation in rock magnetic parameters independent of flow units reflect temporal magnitudes of compositional variability, cooling and emplacement history that needs detailed petro-mineralogical attempts; and the present data is useful for high order inter-core correlations under the deep drilling program."
"Rock strength and elastic properties of basement granitoids from Koyna region, Deccan Volcanic Province, India","Unconfined compressive strength measurements on 20 borehole core samples constrain the elastic properties of basement granitoids underlying the Deccan basalts in the Koyna region for the first time. Test specimens were taken from the basement section below 1251 m depth in borehole KBH-7, which is located in proximity to the Donichawadi surface rupture associated with the 1967 M6.3 Koyna earthquake. Specimens of granite, granite-gneiss and migmatitic gneiss were tested in the laboratory under dry state and room temperature. Salient results of the study are as follows: (i) The granitoids are characterised by variable compressive strength in the range 22–98 MPa, (ii) Stress-strain response of the basement rock indicate varying degrees of deformation even for the same rock type. (iii) Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the granitoids, computed from the linear elastic portion of the stress-strain curves, vary in the range 8–23 GPa and 0.1–0.3 respectively, (iv) The low and variable rock strength of the Koyna granitoids when compared to granitic rocks from aseismic areas indicates their generally weak nature, probably induced by the recurrent seismicity in the Koyna seismogenic zone."
Faulting in Deccan Traps in the vicinity of Koyna-Warna Seismic Zone,"Studies of sustained activity in the Koyna — Warna Seismic Zone have yielded several models of faults in the basement of the Deccan Traps inferred from geophysical and seismic signatures. There is however, a dearth of unambiguous surface manifestations of such faults, apart from the surface ruptures from the epicentral zone of the December, 1967 earthquake. We report for the first time, an exposed NW-SE trending reverse fault in the Deccan Trap basalts from this region."
Effects of light quality on conidiophore formation of the melon powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera xanthii,"The lengths of conidiophores in fungal colonies of the melon powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera xanthii Pollacci KMP-6 N cultured under greenhouse (natural) conditions differed markedly from those cultured in a growth chamber. We hypothesized that light wavelength was responsible for the differences in conidiophore length. In this study, we examined the effects of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (purple, blue, green, orange, and red light) and white light on colony development and conidiophore formation in KMP-6 N using a stereomicroscope and a high-fidelity digital microscope. Colonies on leaves were flat under greenhouse conditions and under red LED light irradiation but were stacked under growth chamber conditions and under purple, blue, green, and orange LED light irradiation. In addition, KMP-6 N formed catenated conidia comprising six conidia per conidiophore under greenhouse conditions and red light but more than seven conidia per conidiophore under growth chamber conditions and purple, blue, green, and orange light. Furthermore, almost none of the conidia on top of the conidiophores grown under blue light were fully constricted. Therefore, these fungi could not scatter their conidia and spread infection. This is the first report of the effects of LED lights on conidiophore formation in the melon powdery mildew fungus P. xanthii. The results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the responses of conidiophores to light of specific wavelengths and conidial scatter from conidiophores of melon powdery mildew fungi."
Influence of Drying on the Recoverable High-Value Products from Olive (cv. Arbequina) Waste Cake,"Olive oil production in Chile has increased 900% in the last 10 years, resulting in a concomitant increase in waste products that need to be managed. In this study, drying assays were conducted in a convective hot-air dryer on Arbequina olive waste cakes between 40 and 90 °C and a constant airflow of 2 m/s. Proximate composition, dietary fiber, minerals, fatty acids, tocopherols, phytochemicals as well as antioxidant activity as DPPH, FRAP and ORAC values were determined. These six drying temperatures were found to have variable effects on general composition of the residues. Fatty acids were found in high concentration at low temperatures where oleic acid was the most abundant and α-tocopherol was the most prevalent form of vitamin E. The phytochemical content (total phenolics, flavonoids and flavanols) represented an average of 20.7% of the waste cake. Fresh cake showed the highest polyphenols and flavonoids content whereas flavanols content was higher at all drying temperatures. 3-Hydroxytyrosol was the most abundant phenolic compound, and found in higher abundance in samples dried at 90 °C. The antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP and DPPH assays decreased with drying or remained unchanged when measured by ORAC assay. Given the nutritional and commercial potential of waste cakes, a drying technology for the preservation of bioactive compounds from waste products is discussed."
X-ray spectroscopic and stroboscopic analysis of pulsed-laser ablation of Zn and its oxidation,"Pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) as an attractive process for ligand-free nanoparticle synthesis represents a multiscale problem to understand the mechanisms and achieve control. Atomic and nanoscale processes interacting with macroscale dynamics in the liquid demand for sensitive tools for in-situ and structural analysis. By adding X-ray methods, we enlarge the available information on millimeter-scale bubble formation down to atomic-scale nanoparticle reactions. X-ray spectroscopy (XAS) can resolve the chemical speciation of the ablated material during the ablation from a zinc wire target showing a first oxidation step from zinc to zinc oxide within some 10 min followed by a slower reaction to hydrozincite. X-ray imaging investigations also give additional information on the bubble dynamics as we demonstrate by comparing the microsecond radiography and optical stroboscopy. We show different features of the detachment of the ablation bubble from a free wire. The location of the first collapse occurs in front of the target. While a first rebound bubble possesses an homogeneous interior, the subsequent rebound consists merely of a cloud of microbubbles."
The Effects of Quinine on Neurophysiological Properties of Dopaminergic Neurons,"Quinine is an antimalarial drug that is toxic to the auditory system by commonly inducing hearing loss and tinnitus, presumably due to its ototoxic effects on disruption of cochlear hair cells and blockade of ion channels of neurons in the auditory system. To a lesser extent, quinine also causes ataxia, tremor, and dystonic reactions. As dopaminergic neurons are implicated to play a role in all of these diseases, we tested the toxicity of quinine on induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and primary dopaminergic (DA) neurons of substantia nigra from mice brain slices. Patch clamp recordings and combined drug treatments were performed to examine key physiological properties of the DA neurons. We found that quinine (12.5–200 μM) depolarized the resting membrane potential and attenuated the amplitudes of rebound spikes induced by hyperpolarization. Action potentials were also broadened in spontaneously spiking neurons. In addition to quinine attenuating hyperpolarization-dependent conductance, the tail currents following withdrawal of hyperpolarizing currents were also attenuated. Taken together, we found that iPSC-derived DA neurons recapitulated all the tested physiological properties of human DA neurons, and quinine had distinct effects on the physiology of both iDA and primary DA neurons. This toxicity of quinine may be the underlying mechanism for the movement disorders of cinchonism or quinism and may play a role in tinnitus modulation."
Correlation between the concentrations of lactoferrin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in meconium,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and lactoferrin (Lf) are among the key components of the innate immune system due to their ability to bind iron with high affinity and thus control inflammation. The aim of this study was to test the use of NGAL and LF measurements in meconium for the assessment of the intrauterine homeostasis. NGAL and Lf concentrations were measured using ELISA kits in all serial meconium portions (n = 81) collected from 20 healthy neonates. Mean ± SD meconium concentration of Lf was 45.07 ± 78.53 µg/g and more than 1000-fold higher compared with that of NGAL at 1.93 ± 2.46 ng/g. The correlation between the two proteins (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) was found only for portions with Lf concentrations > 25 μg/g. High variability of NGAL and Lf concentrations in meconium and their correlations prove their key role as biomarkers of the fetal condition in utero. NGAL and Lf measured in meconium are candidate biomarkers for fetal iron status."
Reinventing discovery learning: a field-wide research program,"Whereas some educational designers believe that students should learn new concepts through explorative problem solving within dedicated environments that constrain key parameters of their search and then support their progressive appropriation of empowering disciplinary forms, others are critical of the ultimate efficacy of this discovery-based pedagogical philosophy, citing an inherent structural challenge of students constructing historically achieved conceptual structures from their ingenuous notions. This special issue presents six educational research projects that, while adhering to principles of discovery-based learning, are motivated by complementary philosophical stances and theoretical constructs. The editorial introduction frames the set of projects as collectively exemplifying the viability and breadth of discovery-based learning, even as these projects: (a) put to work a span of design heuristics, such as productive failure, surfacing implicit know-how, playing epistemic games, problem posing, or participatory simulation activities; (b) vary in their target content and skills, including building electric circuits, solving algebra problems, driving safely in traffic jams, and performing martial-arts maneuvers; and (c) employ different media, such as interactive computer-based modules for constructing models of scientific phenomena or mathematical problem situations, networked classroom collective “video games,” and intercorporeal master–student training practices. The authors of these papers consider the potential generativity of their design heuristics across domains and contexts."

"Cancer Pain Management at Oncology Units: Comparing Knowledge, Attitudes and Perceived Barriers Between Physicians and Nurses","Pain is a major symptom that causes suffering among patients diagnosed with cancer. Identifying physicians’ and nurses’ knowledge, attitudes, and their perceived barriers of cancer pain management is considered an essential step in improving cancer pain relief. The purposes of this study are to compare physicians’ and nurses’ knowledge and attitudes toward cancer pain management (CPM) and describe their perceived barriers to CPM at oncology units. A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to obtain data through self-report questionnaire. The total number of sample size was 207 participants (72 physicians and 135 nurses). Findings revealed that both physicians and nurses had fair knowledge and attitudes toward CPM. Physicians had significantly higher knowledge and better attitudes than nurses (62.3 vs. 51.5%, respectively). Physicians were knowledgeable about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction but had negative attitudes toward pain assessment. Nurses’ knowledge was better in regard of CPM guidelines, while they had poor knowledge about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction. Physicians and nurses perceived knowledge deficit, lack of pain assessment, opioid unavailability, and lack of psychological interventions as the most common barriers to CPM. It is recommended to integrate recent evidence-based guidelines about CPM in oncology units that aim to improve practice. Offering continuing education courses in hospitals guided by pain teams is another essential recommendation for effective CPM."
Functional and DNA–protein binding studies of WRKY transcription factors and their expression analysis in response to biotic and abiotic stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),"WRKY, a plant-specific transcription factor family, plays vital roles in pathogen defense, abiotic stress, and phytohormone signalling. Little is known about the roles and function of WRKY transcription factors in response to rust diseases in wheat. In the present study, three TaWRKY genes encoding complete protein sequences were cloned. They belonged to class II and III WRKY based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of zinc finger structures. Twenty-two DNA–protein binding docking complexes predicted stable interactions of WRKY domain with W-box. Quantitative real-time-PCR using wheat near-isogenic lines with or without Lr28 gene revealed differential up- or down-regulation in response to biotic and abiotic stress treatments which could be responsible for their functional divergence in wheat. TaWRKY62 was found to be induced upon treatment with JA, MJ, and SA and reduced after ABA treatments. Maximum induction of six out of seven genes occurred at 48 h post inoculation due to pathogen inoculation. Hence, TaWRKY (49, 50, 52, 55, 57, and 62) can be considered as potential candidate genes for further functional validation as well as for crop improvement programs for stress resistance. The results of the present study will enhance knowledge towards understanding the molecular basis of mode of action of WRKY transcription factor genes in wheat and their role during leaf rust pathogenesis in particular."
Fouling mitigation and cleanability of TiO2 photocatalyst-modified PVDF membranes during ultrafiltration of model oily wastewater with different salt contents,"In the present study, TiO2-coated ultrafiltration membranes were prepared and used for oily water filtration (droplet size < 2 μm). The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different salt contents on fouling and filtration properties of neat and TiO2-coated membranes during oil-in-water emulsion filtration. The effect of the TiO2 coating on the flux, surface free energy, and retention values was measured and compared with the neat membrane values. The cleanability of the fouled TiO2-coated membranes by UV irradiation was also investigated by measuring flux recovery and contact angles, and the chemical changes during cleaning were characterized by ATR-IR. It was found that increasing the salt content of the model wastewaters, oil-in-water emulsions, increased the zeta potential and the size of the droplets. The presence of the TiO2 coating decreases the membrane fouling during oily emulsion filtration compared to the neat membrane, due to the hydrophilicity of the coating regardless of the salt content of the emulsions. The neat and coated membrane oil retention was similar, 96 ± 2%. The coated membrane can be effectively cleaned with UV irradiation without additional chemicals and a significant flux recovery can be achieved. Monitoring of the cleaning process by following the membrane surface wettability and ATR-IR measurements showed that the recovery of flux does not mean the total elimination of the oil layer from the membrane surface."
Predicting Cu and Zn sorption capacity of biochar from feedstock C/N ratio and pyrolysis temperature,"Biochars have been proposed for remediation of metal-contaminated water due to their low cost, high surface area and high sorption capacity for metals. However, there is a lack of understanding over how feedstock material and pyrolysis conditions contribute to the metal sorption capacity of biochar. We produced biochars from 10 different organic materials by pyrolysing at 450 °C and a further 10 biochars from cedar wood by pyrolysing at 50 °C intervals (250–700 °C). Batch sorption experiments were conducted to derive the maximum Cu and Zn sorption capacity of each biochar. The results revealed an exponential relationship between Cu and Zn sorption capacity and the feedstock C/N ratio and a sigmoidal relationship between the pyrolysis temperature and the maximum Cu and Zn sorption capacity. FTIR analysis revealed that as temperature increased, the abundance of functional groups reduced. We conclude that the high sorption capacity of high temperature biochars is due to an electrostatic attraction between positively charged Cu and Zn ions and delocalised pi-electrons on the greater surface area of these biochars. These findings demonstrate a method for predicting the maximum sorption capacity of a biochar based on the feedstock C/N ratio and the pyrolysis temperature."
Gene expression analysis to identify mechanisms underlying heart failure susceptibility in mice and humans,"Genetic factors are known to modulate cardiac susceptibility to ventricular hypertrophy and failure. To determine how strain influences the transcriptional response to pressure overload-induced heart failure (HF) and which of these changes accurately reflect the human disease, we analyzed the myocardial transcriptional profile of mouse strains with high (C57BL/6J) and low (129S1/SvImJ) susceptibility for HF development, which we compared to that of human failing hearts. Following transverse aortic constriction (TAC), C57BL/6J mice developed overt HF while 129S1/SvImJ did not. Despite a milder aortic constriction, impairment of ejection fraction and ventricular remodeling (dilation, fibrosis) was more pronounced in C57BL/6J mice. Similarly, changes in myocardial gene expression were more robust in C57BL/6J (461 genes) compared to 129S1/SvImJ mice (71 genes). When comparing these patterns to human dilated cardiomyopathy (1344 genes), C57BL/6J mice tightly grouped to human hearts. Overlay and bioinformatic analysis of the transcriptional profiles of C57BL/6J mice and human failing hearts identified six co-regulated genes (POSTN, CTGF, FN1, LOX, NOX4, TGFB2) with established link to HF development. Pathway enrichment analysis identified angiotensin and IGF-1 signaling as most enriched putative upstream regulator and pathway, respectively, shared between TAC-induced HF in C57BL/6J mice and in human failing hearts. TAC-induced heart failure in C57BL/6J mice more closely reflects the gene expression pattern of human dilated cardiomyopathy compared to 129S1/SvImJ mice. Unbiased as well as targeted gene expression and pathway analyses identified periostin, angiotensin signaling, and IGF-1 signaling as potential causes of increased HF susceptibility in C57BL/6J mice and as potentially useful drug targets for HF treatment."
Membrane sweeping added to formal induction method to increase the spontaneous vaginal delivery: a meta-analysis,"Membrane sweeping (MS) could increase the likelihood of spontaneous labor within 48 h. However, the rationale for performing routinely an intervention with the potential to induce labor in women with an uneventful pregnancy at 38 weeks of gestation is, at least, questionable. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies to assess evaluated the effect of MS added to formal induction method on the spontaneous vaginal delivery, compared with formal induction alone."
"RASSF1A promoter methylation was associated with the development, progression and metastasis of cervical carcinoma: a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis","RASSF1A promoter methylation has been reported in cervical cancer. However, clinical effect of RASSF1A promoter methylation in cervical cancer remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between RASSF1A promoter methylation and cervical cancer and the association of RASSF1A promoter methylation with clinicopathological features."
High levels of serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) predict the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients treated with nucleot(s)ide analogues,"Nucleot(s)ide analogues (NA) can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but not completely prevent its development."
Comparison of efficacies of fetal bovine sera from different suppliers in cell culture experiments,"Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is widely used as a culture medium supplement. A high degree of variations is observed among FBS samples produced by different suppliers. The purpose of the present study was to compare between the quality and characteristics of FBS produced at Avicenna Research Institute (ARI-FBS) and a commercial FBS. Blood samples were taken from 50 healthy bovine fetuses at 2–9 months of age. Following clotting of the blood, samples were centrifuged. Their sera were collected under sterile conditions. After irradiation, to investigate the performance and quality assurance of the serum samples, some biological properties in cell culture applications, including capacities in supporting single cell growth, proliferation, and cell viability were examined by cell cloning, MTT assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Comparison of ARI-FBS with commercial FBS showed that both of them were expedient and reliable for use in culture studies. However, significant differences in growth rates of different cell lines were observed between them. Results of MTT assay showed that L929 cell line had a significantly better viability in ARI-FBS. Conversely, PC3 and SW480 cell lines were more viable in commercial FBS. In cloning experiments and flow cytometry, both sera showed similar efficiencies. ARI-FBS supported cell growth and maintained cell viabilities in a similar manner to the commercial FBS. ARI-FBS may thus be a proper alternative for commercial FBS as a growth-promoting component for successful culture of cell lines."
"Potential demographic, clinical, and environment risk factors for canine visceral leishmaniasis using IFAT and nested PCR, southeastern Iran","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal disease with major veterinary and medical impacts. In the present study, we investigated the significance of potential demographic, clinical, and environmental risk factors for canine VL (CVL), southeastern Iran. This study was performed between 2014 and 2015 on 210 randomly selected stray dogs which were caught by live traps. A 5 ml blood sample was taken from cephalic vein for indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and nested PCR. The cut-off titer for IFAT was 1:320. For molecular test, two sets of general and specific primers were used to amplify variable mini circle region of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Data analyses were performed by x
2 and logistic regression tests at P < 0.05. Overall, 210 dogs consisting of 87 males and 123 females were examined and 14 dogs (6.7%) were considered infected with VL. Age < 2 years (OR = 14.106, CI = 1.810–109.924, P = 0.012); short hair (OR = 15.311 CI = 1.965–119.324, P = 0.009); solid waste (OR = 0.050 CI = 0.006–0.388, P = 0.004); weather with water, clouds, and creek (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.011–0.692, P = 0.021); and nearby dog present (OR = 0.065, CI 0.008–0.509, P = 0.009) were the major risk factors associated with CVL. In contrast, sex, tick infested, meadow, and clinical signs were negatively associated odds of infection. Control approaches should be directed toward specific demographic and environmental factors to reduce the risk of CVL in the area."
Agricultural Innovation and the Role of Institutions: Lessons from the Game of Drones,"In 2015, observers argued that the fourth agricultural revolution had been initiated. This article focuses on one part of this high-tech revolution: the origin, development, applications, and user value of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Institutional changes connected to the UAS innovation are analyzed, based on a Swedish case study. The methods included autoethnography. The theoretical frame was composed by four perspectives: innovation, institutions, sustainability, and ethics. UAS can help farmers cut costs and produce higher quantity with better quality, and also has environmental benefits. However, this promising innovation was exposed to institutional forces and suddenly became subordinated the Act of Camera Surveillance. This study illuminates how legislative institutions can inhibit responsible innovation. The study shows that different ethical perspectives can collide with each other."
Brain lipid binding protein mediates the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells by regulating ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vitro,"Brain lipid binding protein (BLBP) is highly expressed in the radial glial cells (RGCs) of the central nervous system (CNS), in glioblastomas, and, in vitro, in U251 cells. In this report, we have demonstrated that increased BLBP expression in glioblastoma is associated with poor survival and used a double-vector CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral system to deplete endogenous BLBP from U251 cells, we found that loss of BLBP induced cell growth inhibition and S-phase arrest. Moreover, an increase in P53 and a decrease in p-ERK1/2 were observed after BLBP depletion, suggesting a potential mechanism by which loss of BLBP results in growth inhibition."
Does Parent Training Format Affect Treatment Engagement? A Randomized Study of Families at Social Risk,"We examined whether parent engagement in parent training (PT) differed based on PT format (parent group-based with video versus mastery-based individual coaching with child) in an economically disadvantaged sample of families seeking behavioral treatment for their preschool children in an urban mental health clinic. Parents (N = 159; 76.1% mothers, 69.8% African American, 73% low-income) were randomized to one of two interventions, Chicago Parent Program (parent group + video; CPP) or Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (individualized mastery-based coaching; PCIT). Parent engagement indicators compared were PT attendance and completion rates, participation quality, and parent satisfaction. Risk factors predictive of PT attrition (parent depression, psychosocial adversity, child behavior problem severity, length of wait time to start PT) were also compared to determine whether they were more likely to affect engagement in one PT format versus the other. No significant differences were found in PT attendance or completion rates by format. Clinicians rated parents’ engagement higher in PCIT than in CPP while satisfaction with PT was rated higher by parents in CPP compared to PCIT. Never attending PT was associated with more psychosocial adversity and externalizing behavior problems for CPP and with higher baseline depression for PCIT. Parents with more psychosocial adversities and higher baseline depression were less likely to complete PCIT. None of the risk factors differentiated CPP completers from non-completers. Delay to treatment start was longer for PCIT than CPP. Strengths and limitations of each PT format are discussed as they relate to the needs and realities of families living in urban poverty."
Multiple functions of CREB-binding protein during postembryonic development: identification of target genes,"Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect."
The emerging picture of the mitochondrial protein import complexes of Amoebozoa supergroup,"The existence of mitochondria-related organelles (MROs) is proposed for eukaryotic organisms. The Amoebozoa includes some organisms that are known to have mitosomes but also organisms that have aerobic mitochondria. However, the mitochondrial protein apparatus of this supergroup remains largely unsampled, except for the mitochondrial outer membrane import complexes studied recently. Therefore, in this study we investigated the mitochondrial inner membrane and intermembrane space complexes, using the available genome and transcriptome sequences."
A novel method to fabricate silicon nanoprobe array with ultra-sharp tip on (111) silicon wafer,"In the work, a novel fabrication method for homogeneous and sharp nanoprobe array on (111) silicon wafer is presented. The specific spatial structure of {111} planes and the unique anisotropic etching mechanism on (111) wafer were utilized to form a size controllable funnel-neck structure. A highly downscaled size-reduction technology is developed for precise size control. Followed with a self-limiting oxidation procedure, sharp and long needles can be made with precise size control requiring only a series of conventional processes (dry etching of silicon by DRIE, anisotropic wet etching by potassium hydroxide solution and thermal-oxidation-based tip sharpening). The fabricated probe, whose tip’s diameter is less than 30 nm, can potentially have broad application to cell research."
Evaluation of vertebral artery anomaly in basilar invagination and prevention of vascular injury during surgical intervention: CTA features and analysis,"To evaluate vertebral artery anomaly at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) in patients with basilar invagination (BI) by computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and to discuss the prevention strategy of vascular injury."
Strafverfolgung darf die IT-Sicherheit im Internet nicht schwächen,"Der zunehmende Einsatz von Verschlüsselung im Internet stellt die Strafverfolgungsbehörden aktuell vor eine neue Herausforderung: Um an die Klartextdaten von potentiellen Straftätern zu kommen, soll zukünftig staatlich geförderte Schadsoftware, sogenannte Bundestrojaner, eingesetzt werden. Dieser Artikel thematisiert die daraus resultierenden Probleme und negativen Auswirkungen aus Sicht der IT-Sicherheit. Der Bundestrojaner ist in der Gesamtbetrachtung nicht beherrschbar und verursacht wahrscheinlich mehr Cyberkriminalität anstelle von Aufklärung."
Methylphenidate disrupts cytoskeletal homeostasis and reduces membrane-associated lipid content in juvenile rat hippocampus,"Although methylphenidate (MPH) is ubiquitously prescribed to children and adolescents, the consequences of chronic utilization of this psychostimulant are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of MPH on cytoskeletal homeostasis and lipid content in rat hippocampus. Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of MPH (2.0 mg/kg) or saline solution (controls), once a day, from the 15th to the 44th day of age. Results showed that MPH provoked hypophosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and reduced its immunocontent. Middle and high molecular weight neurofilament subunits (NF-M, NF-H) were hypophosphorylated by MPH on KSP repeat tail domains, while NFL, NFM and NFH immunocontents were not altered. MPH increased protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) immunocontents. MPH also decreased the total content of ganglioside and phospholipid, as well as the main brain gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, and GD1b) and the major brain phospholipids (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine). Total cholesterol content was also reduced in the hippocampi of juvenile rats treated with MPH. These results provide evidence that disruptions of cytoskeletal and lipid homeostasis in hippocampus of juvenile rats are triggers by chronic MPH treatment and present a new basis for understanding the effects and consequences associated with chronic use of this psychostimulant during the development of the central nervous system."
Transparent and Edible Films from Ultrasound-Treated Egg Yolk Granules,"Whole egg yolk can be easily separated into two fractions, plasma and granules, the former of which is rich in lipids and the latter has a high protein content. Searching for new applications for each fraction could increase the value of the whole egg. In this work, the egg yolk granule fraction is being proposed and used to create transparent, edible films. For that purpose, a solution of egg yolk granules was pre-treated using high intensity ultrasound. A Box-Behnken design was established to determine the effect of temperature, ultrasound intensity and the pre-treatment time on the clarity of the granules solution and the transparency of the films obtained. Furthermore, the films were analysed to test the effect of the ultrasound pre-treatment on their mechanical properties, solubility, colour, thermal stability and structure. The optimal conditions for obtaining highly transparent films from egg yolk granules solution were found to be the following: 45 °C, for 40 min and applying ultrasounds at 60% amplitude. With this pre-treatment, the puncture strength value of the films improved from 9 N/mm, in the case of the untreated granules solution, to 31.6 N/mm. The puncture deformation showed a similar trend. All the films made with egg yolk granules showed a low water solubility. The colour of the films was not affected by the ultrasound pre-treatment."
Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Peptide-Conjugates: Modulation of Activity by Charged and Hydrophobic Residues,"In the present study, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of a series of quinazolinone-conjugated-peptides were investigated. Substitution of second position of the peptide template ‘GXGVP’ by different amino acids of varying hydrophobicity, charge and polarity has been studied. Quinazolinone-peptides with Trp residue emerged out as the highly potential antioxidant whereas the conjugate with Asp moiety turned to be a good anti-inflammatory agent. These data indicate that more hydrophobicity favours antioxidant property and contrarily, presence of charged species in the molecule assists the reduction of inflammation. Further, conjugates having butyl group in the heterocyclic part and free C-terminus in the peptide part exhibited good inflammation reducing property. Thus, variation of hydrophobic groups, charges and polarity of certain amino acids in the peptide segment of the conjugate could be used to develop “dual war-head” potential therapeutics for treating inflammation and allied diseases."
Adsorption properties of Pseudomonas monteilii for removal of uranium from aqueous solution,"The Pseudomonas monteilii. YL-1 was cultured from deep sea sediment to remove uranium from aqueous solution. Different influence factors on uranium adsorption efficiency were investigated. The kinetic model of Pseudomonas monteilii could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the Freundlich isotherm model could fit the experiment data well, indicating that the adsorption was multilayer adsorption. The adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic reaction by thermodynamic analysis. The functional groups of Pseudomonas monteilii such as hydroxy, carboxyl, amino and amide may act with UO22+ by chemisorption or strong complexation in the process of uranium adsorption."
Re-thinking university spin-off: a critical literature review and a research agenda,"In recent years, universities have focused more on the creation of spin-off companies as a means of transferring the knowledge generated by their research activities. At the same time, this has generated an increase in academic research on this business structure in order to identify the best strategies for their management and the most efficient university policies, amongst other things. In this study, we have identified and evaluated the literature on university spin-offs published in journals included in the Social Sciences Citation Index of the Web of Science in order to identify what, by whom, where and how it has been researched. The number of studies was marginal until 2000 but has grown exponentially since 2010. Our systematic review classifies research findings into three levels—individual, firm, and institutional context—each with respect to characteristics, antecedents, and outcomes of entrepreneurial activities. Reviewing the content of these articles allows some gaps in the research to be identified and conclusions to be reached about possible future research in this field to supplement, update and extend the results obtained to date."
The January 2013 Beijing “Airpocalypse” and its acute effects on emergency and outpatient visits at a Beijing hospital,"Severe air pollution episodes in Europe and the USA in the early- to mid-twentieth century caused large health impacts, spurring national legislation. Similarly severe episodes currently affect developing regions, as exemplified by a particularly extreme episode in January 2013 in Beijing, China. We investigated associations between this episode and medical visits at a Beijing hospital. We obtained fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measurements from the US State Department’s Embassy monitor and daily counts of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory emergency visits, and outpatient visits from a nearby hospital in the Liufang Nanli community. We analyzed whether risks increased during this episode (with daily PM2.5 ≥ 350 μg/m3) using generalized linear modeling, controlling for potential confounders. The episode brought exceptionally high PM2.5 (peak daily average, 569 μg/m3). Risk increased during the episode for all-cause (relative risk 1.29 [95% CI 1.13, 1.46]), cardiovascular (1.55 [0.90, 2.68]) and respiratory (1.33 [1.10, 1.62]) emergency medical visits, and respiratory outpatient visits (1.16 [1.00, 1.33]). Relative risks of all-cause (0.95 [0.82, 1.10]) and cardiovascular (0.83 [0.67, 1.02]) outpatient visits were not statistically significant. Results were robust to modeling choices and episode definitions. This episode was extraordinarily severe, with maximum daily PM2.5 concentration nearly 22-fold above the World Health Organization guideline. During the episode, risk increased for all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory emergency medical visits, and respiratory outpatient visits, consistent with previous US-based research. However, no association was found for all-cause or cardiovascular outpatient visits. China-based studies like this one provide critical evidence in developing efforts regarding air pollution remediation in China."
Reducing the Risk of Postpartum Depression in a Low-Income Community Through a Community Health Worker Intervention,"Objectives To clarify the effectiveness of perinatal social support interventions in reducing postpartum depression among minority, low-income women. Methods The Transdisciplinary Research Consortium for Gulf Resilience on Women’s Health supported a community-based participatory research project to improve perinatal health among low-income, first-time pregnant women living in a vulnerable Gulf Coast region. Community health workers (CHWs) were partnered with recruited women, and used a mix of mobile technology and home visits to develop a supportive relationship during the perinatal period. Results Women enrolled in the CHW-led intervention had lower (F: 2.38, p = 0.04) average postpartum depression scores (EPDS) 6 months postpartum than a comparison population. The difference, however, was not seen among women in the intervention group who reported relatively poor relationships with their CHWs. Conclusions for Practice Results reinforce the evidence that perinatal social support can affect postpartum depression outcomes. CHWs are increasingly utilized by public programs to reach at-risk populations. We discuss the potential efficacy of CHW programs, but also, the need to pair outreach with effective monitoring and evaluation of the relationship development between CHW and clients."
Reduced-reference quality assessment of DIBR-synthesized images based on multi-scale edge intensity similarity,"Depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) plays an important role in view synthesis for free-viewpoint videos. The warping process in DIBR causes geometric displacement, which distributes intensively around edges, and the subsequent rendering process results in the impairment of edges. Traditional 2D image quality metrics are limited in the quality evaluation of DIBR-synthesized images. In this paper, we present a reduced-reference quality metric for DIBR-synthesized images by only extracting several feature values, namely multi-scale Edge Intensity Similarity (EIS). The original and synthesized images are first downsampled to generate images with different resolutions. Then an edge detection process is conducted on each scale and the edge intensity is calculated. The similarity of the edge intensity between each downsampled original image and the corresponding synthesized image is computed. Finally, the average similarity is calculated as the quality score of the DIBR-synthesized image. Experiments conducted on IRCCyN/IVC DIBR image and video databases demonstrate that the proposed method overall outperforms traditional 2D and existing DIBR-targeted quality metrics."
Analyzing Predictors of Drinking and Driving among Gender Cohorts within a College Sample,"The current study focuses on predominant predictors associated with men’s and women’s engagement in driving under the influence (DUI) in an attempt to determine whether gender-specific interventions would be more affective at reducing impaired vehicle operation. A male-only subsample (n = 863) and a female-only subsample (n = 975) from a survey administered at a large Southeastern university containing self-reported measures of DUI were used to evaluate gender differences in motivations and correlates of DUI behavior. A series of logistic regressions containing indicators drawn from theories of deviant behavior (e.g., Akers’ social learning theory (SLT) and Gottfredson and Hirshi’s low self-control (LSC) theory) yield results indicating that differential association and imitation, both factors associated with SLT, are significant predictors for both gender cohorts’ DUI behavior. Low self- control was a significant predictor within female-only models, but not the final male-only models. This suggests that peer associations and modeling may be targets of intervention generally, but that, as it relates to DUIs, women may particularly benefit from programs focused at limiting impulsivity and risk-taking behavior as these are components of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s LSC construct."
Toll-Like Receptor 2-Mediated Glial Cell Activation in a Mouse Model of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by myelin abnormalities, oligodendrocyte pathology, and concomitant glia activation. The factors triggering gliosis and demyelination are currently not well characterized. New findings suggest an important role of the innate immune response in the initiation and progression of active demyelinating lesions. Especially during progressive disease, aberrant glia activation rather than the invasion of peripheral immune cells is accountable for progressive neuronal injury. The innate immune response can be induced by pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns, which are identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In this study, we used the cuprizone model in mice to investigate the expression of TLR2 during the course of cuprizone-induced demyelination. In addition, we used TLR2-deficient mice to analyze the functional role of TLR2 activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination and reactive gliosis. We show a significantly increased expression of TLR2 in the corpus callosum and hippocampus of cuprizone-intoxicated mice. The absence of receptor signaling in TLR2-deficient mice resulted in less severe reactive astrogliosis in the corpus callosum and cortex. In addition, microglia activation was ameliorated in the corpus callosum of TLR2-deficient mice, but augmented in the cortex compared to wild-type littermates. Extent of demyelination and loss of mature oligodendrocytes was comparable in both genotypes. These results suggest that the TLR2 orchestrates glia activation during gray and white matter demyelination in the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier. Future studies now have to address the underlying mechanisms of the region-specific TLR2-mediated glia activation."
Hopf bifurcation and Turing instability in a predator–prey model with Michaelis–Menten functional response,"In this paper, the predator–prey model with Michaelis–Menten functional response subject to the Neumann boundary conditions is considered. The stability of the positive equilibrium and the direction of the Hopf bifurcations for the corresponding ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation are studied, respectively. To this end, the normal form method and the center manifold theorem are applied to determine the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcated limit cycle when the diffusion terms are present. It is shown that the corresponding system can undergo either the supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point within certain parameter range. Meanwhile, the Turing instability conditions for the equilibrium and the limit cycle bifurcated from the Hopf bifurcation are derived. As a result, some patterns occur in the model. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the theoretical analysis."
Microwave photonics reconfigurable mixer based on polarization modulator,"A reconfigurable and stable mixer is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. It mainly consists of a dual-driven Mach–Zehnder modulator and a polarization modulator with several polarization controllers (PC) and polarizers (Pol). According to the theoretical analysis, different functions (such as single ended mixer, balanced mixer, I/Q mixer and image rejection mixer) can be realized by adjusting the PCs and Pols. The simulation results verify the possibility of multi-functions that realized by the reconfigurable mixer. In addition, another research on how the non-ideal parameters affect the image rejection ratio (ISR) and conversion efficiency of the mixer is also carried. The results show that both of them perform better as the extinction ratio gets higher. However, they are incurring a sharp decrease if the DC bias points deviate from the settled values. In the meantime, the results also indicate that the higher modulation indices lead to a better ISR. A 57.12 dB ISR can be achieved with conversion efficiency of − 9.53 dB."
Alpha decay studies on Po isotopes using different versions of nuclear potentials,"The alpha decays from 186-224Po isotopes have been studied using 25 different versions of nuclear potentials so as to select a suitable nuclear potential for alpha decay studies. The computed standard deviation of the calculated half-lives in comparison with the experimental data suggested that proximity 2003-I is the apt form of nuclear potential for alpha decay studies as it possesses the least standard deviation, \( \sigma =0.620\) . Among the different proximity potentials, proximity 1966 ( \( \sigma =0.630\) and proximity 1977 ( \( \sigma =0.636\) , are also found to work well in alpha decay studies with low deviation. Among other versions of nuclear potentials (other than proximity potentials), Bass 1980 is suggested to be a significant form of nuclear potential because of its good predictive power. However, while the other forms of potentials are able to reproduce the experimental data to some extent, these potentials cannot be considered as apposite potentials for alpha decay studies in their present form. Since the experimental correlation of the models is noticed to be satisfying, the alpha decay half-lives of certain Po isotopes that are not detected experimentally yet have been predicted."
CP violation in leptonic rare \(B^0_s\) decays as a probe of new physics,"The decay \(B^0_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\) is a key probe for the search of physics beyond the Standard Model. While the current measurements of the corresponding branching ratio agree with the Standard Model within the uncertainties, significant New-Physics effects may still be hiding in \(B^0_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\). In order to reveal them, the observable \(\mathcal {A}^{\mu \mu }_{\Delta \Gamma _s}\), which is provided by the decay width difference \(\Delta \Gamma _s\) of the \(B^0_s\)-meson system, plays a central role. We point out that a measurement of a CP-violating observable \(\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{\mu \mu }\), which is induced through interference between \(B^0_s\)–\({\bar{B}}^0_s\) mixing and \(B_s\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\) decay processes, is essential to obtain the full picture, in particular to establish new scalar contributions and CP-violating phases. We illustrate these findings with future scenarios for the upgrade(s) of the LHC, exploiting also relations which emerge within an effective field theory description of the Standard Model, complemented with New Physics entering significantly beyond the electroweak scale."
"Charmonia production from b-hadron decays at LHC with \(k_T\)-factorization: \(J/\psi \), \(\psi (2S)\) and \(J/\psi + Z\)","We consider the production of \(J/\psi \) and \(\psi (2S)\) mesons originating from the decays of b-flavored hadrons at the LHC using the \(k_T\)-factorization approach. Our analysis covers both inclusive charmonia production and production of \(J/\psi \) mesons in association with Z bosons. We apply the transverse momentum dependent (or unintegrated) gluon density in a proton derived from Catani–Ciafaloni–Fiorani–Marchesini (CCFM) evolution equation and adopt fragmentation functions based on the non-relativistic QCD factorization to describe the inclusive b-hadron decays into the different charmonium states. Our predictions agree well with latest experimental data taken by the CMS, ATLAS and LHCb Collaborations at \(\sqrt{s} = 7\), 8 and 13 TeV. The contributions from double parton scattering to the associated non-prompt \(J/\psi + Z\) production are estimated and found to be small."
Transverse Isotropy of Phyllite Under Brazilian Tests: Laboratory Testing and Numerical Simulations,"Phyllite is a low-grade, metamorphic rock with well-developed foliation. We characterized the fracture pattern and failure strength of phyllite specimens under Brazilian tests. The specimens were obtained from the Zhegu mountain tunnel in China and had different foliation-loading angles, namely 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90°. The processes for the initiation and propagation of macro-cracks were recorded using high-speed photography. The evolution of micro-cracks was analyzed based on the results of acoustic emission (AE) tests. The failure process of the specimens during the Brazilian tests was simulated with a new numerical approach based on the particle discrete element method. The influence of foliation strength and the microstructure of the rock matrix were also studied numerically. The experimental results showed that the failure strength of the specimens was related to their fracture patterns and the areas of their fracture surfaces. The initial cracking point of the specimens appeared at the upper or lower loading position, and the cracks propagated to the boundaries of the specimens along or across foliation. The temporal distributions of the AE counts and AE energy of the specimens were affected predominantly by the fracture pattern, and we divided these distributions into two modes: the peak mode and the uniformly distributed mode. The numerical results indicated that the fracture surface was roughly parallel to the loading direction and that the surface was located in the central part of the disk specimens for rocks with loose structure (low coordination number or large crack density) or with strong foliation, i.e., foliation with high shear strength. The failure pattern and trends of variation in failure strength as a function of foliation-loading angles varied with the ratio of cohesion to the tensile strength of foliation, the crack density, and the coordination number."
"Analysis of ibuprofen and its main metabolites in roots, shoots, and seeds of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry: uptake, metabolism, and translocation","A liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–QqTOF-MS/MS) method was developed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of ibuprofen (IBU), 1- and 2-hydroxyibuprofen (1-OH IBU and 2-OH IBU), and carboxyibuprofen (CBX IBU) while preserving the ability of the instrument to get precursor and product ion mass spectra of non-target compounds. The trigger was the precursor ions reaching 100 cps intensity. Sample preparation was carried out by ultrasound solid-liquid extraction with methanol as extraction solvent at pH < 2 followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up using STRATA-X cartridges and methanol as an eluent. Linearity was obtained in the range 50–10,000 ng mL−1 for IBU, each OH IBU and CBX IBU (r ≥ 0.99). The proposed method was satisfactorily validated showing absolute recoveries of > 70% for all target analytes at low and high concentration levels. The lowest limit of quantification was < 50 ng g−1 in plant. This method was applied to investigate IBP behavior in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) treated at high IBU concentrations and its presence in vegetables irrigated with treated water. Up to 46 metabolites, mostly hydroxylated metabolites and conjugates with hexosides and amino acids, were identified. The most abundant metabolites were also identified in an eggplant sample."
On the sum of digits of special sequences in finite fields,"In \(\mathbb {F}_q\), Dartyge and Sárközy introduced the notion of digits and studied some properties of the sum of digits function. We will provide sharp estimates for the number of elements of special sequences of \(\mathbb {F}_q\) whose sum of digits is prescribed. Such special sequences of particular interest include the set of n-th powers for each \(n\ge 1\) and the set of elements of order d in \(\mathbb {F}_q^*\) for each divisor d of \(q-1\). We provide an optimal estimate for the number of squares whose sum of digits is prescribed. Our methods combine A. Weil bounds with character sums, Gaussian sums and exponential sums."
Improved decision making in multiagent system for diagnostic application using cooperative learning algorithms,"Cooperative nature in multiagent system inculcates more understanding and data by sharing the resources. So cooperation in a multiagent system gives higher efficiency and faster learning compared to that of single learning. However, there are some challenges in front of learning in a cooperative manner in the multiagent system that needs to pay attention. Making effective cooperative decisions that correctly and efficiently solve interacting problems requires agents to closely cooperate their actions during problem-solving. So various  issues related with cooperative machine learning are implemented. Reinforcement learning is mainly implemented with game theory and robot applications. Paper gives the new approach for reinforcement learning methods applied to the diagnostic application. The novelty of the approach lies in the amalgamation two methods i.e. weighted strategy sharing with expertness parameter that enhances the learning performance. Weighted strategy method is implemented with Sarsa (λ), Q(λ) and Sarsa learning for cooperation between the agents that was not implemented previously. Cooperative learning model with individual and cooperative learning is given in this paper. Weighted Strategy Sharing algorithms calculate the weight of each Q table based upon expertness value. Variation of WSS method with Q-learning and Sarsa learning is implemented in this paper. The paper shows implementation results and performance comparison of Weighted Strategy Sharing with Q-learning, Q(λ), Sarsa learning and Sarsa(λ) algorithms."
Scalable non-negative matrix tri-factorization,"Matrix factorization is a well established pattern discovery tool that has seen numerous applications in biomedical data analytics, such as gene expression co-clustering, patient stratification, and gene-disease association mining. Matrix factorization learns a latent data model that takes a data matrix and transforms it into a latent feature space enabling generalization, noise removal and feature discovery. However, factorization algorithms are numerically intensive, and hence there is a pressing challenge to scale current algorithms to work with large datasets. Our focus in this paper is matrix tri-factorization, a popular method that is not limited by the assumption of standard matrix factorization about data residing in one latent space. Matrix tri-factorization solves this by inferring a separate latent space for each dimension in a data matrix, and a latent mapping of interactions between the inferred spaces, making the approach particularly suitable for biomedical data mining."

Optimal power allocation for downlink two-user non-orthogonal multiple access in visible light communication,"In this work, we consider employing the NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) technique in downlink VLC (Visible Light Communication) for performance enhancement. In particular, focusing on a typical NOMA scenario with two users, we optimize the power allocation strategies under both sum-rate maximization and max-min fairness criteria, where practical optical power and QoS (Quality of Service) constraints are included. As our main contribution, we achieve optimal power allocation solutions in semi-closed forms via mathematical analysis, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been reported in literature. Simulation results demonstrate that NOMA can provide remarkable performance gains over OMA (Orthogonal Multiple Access) in the context of VLC downlinks."
Energy saving for data centers using spatial multichannel optical wireless communication,"Data centers are crucial elements in modern information technology. In order to implement the next generation of data centers, new challenges must be overcome. These include reducing the energy consumption, increasing the data rates, reducing the communication latency, increasing the flexibility and scalability, and reducing the maintenance time and cost. One promising way for meeting these challenges is to employ multichannel optical wireless communication as part of the data center hybrid communication network. In this paper, we analyze three technologies that could be used in this context: MIMO (Multiple-in-Multipleout), multiplexing through orbital angular momentum of light, and direct modulation through the large number of modes associated with orbital angular momentum. Our results indicate that these technologies could provide an innovative and flexible means of meeting the challenges of the next generation of data centers."
Hardware-in-the-loop simulation system for space information networks,"Thanks to the recent advances in SIS (Space Information Science) and increasingly mature technologies, network simulations have attracted much attention, which play vital roles in research on validation of the correctness of SIN's (Space Information Network) solutions. In this paper, we constitute an architecture of a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system, where we use a server to act as a real satellite of SINs. Moreover, we model the channel of the satellite network relying on real cables and servers by referring to the Corazza model. Furthermore, based on the data of real weather events, we propose a coordinate mode for reducing LEO's (Low Earth Orbit) communication delay and validate the efficiency of our proposed method on simulation platform by simplifying the problem to a shortest path problem."
Postoperative extracranial metastasis from glioblastoma: a case report and review of the literature,Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Extraneural metastases are rarely reported in the literature.
Nucleoli cytomorphology in cutaneous melanoma cells – a new prognostic approach to an old concept,"The nucleolus is an organelle that is an ultrastructural element of the cell nucleus observed in H&E staining as a roundish body stained with eosin due to its high protein content. Changes in the nucleoli cytomorphology were one of the first histopathological characteristics of malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the cytomorphological characteristics of nucleoli and detailed clinicopathological parameters of melanoma patients. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between cytomorphological parameters of nucleoli and immunoreactivity of selected proteins responsible for, among others, regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (SPARC, N-cadherin), cell adhesion and motility (ALCAM, ADAM-10), mitotic divisions (PLK1), cellular survival (FOXP1) and the functioning of Golgi apparatus (GOLPH3, GP73)."
Self-help and help-seeking for communication disability in Ghana: implications for the development of communication disability rehabilitation services,"In low and middle-income countries, such as Ghana, communication disability is poorly recognised and rehabilitation services for people with communication disability are limited. As rehabilitation services for communication disability develop, and the profession of speech-language pathology grows, it is important to consider how services can most appropriately respond to the needs and preferences of the community. Understanding the ways in which people currently self-help and seek help for communication disability is central to developing services that build on existing local practices and are relevant to the community."
Should high risk patients with concomitant severe aortic stenosis and mitral valve disease undergo double valve surgery in the TAVR era?,Significant mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to determine if surgical correction of both aortic and mitral valves in high risk patients with concomitant valvular disease would offer patients better outcomes than TAVR alone.
